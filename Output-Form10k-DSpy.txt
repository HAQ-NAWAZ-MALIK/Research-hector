Compliance with these regulations is costly and can impact competitiveness. Violations by employees, contractors, or agents could result in fines, criminal sanctions, business prohibitions, and reputational damage.

    Changes to these laws or their interpretation could lead to increased compliance costs and restrictions. Specifically mentioned are increased scrutiny from regulators regarding cybersecurity and AI. The company is facing increased interest in its business from regulators worldwide, including ongoing inquiries into competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider markets. Broad requests for information have been received from competition regulators regarding sales of GPUs, efforts to allocate supply, foundation models and investments with companies developing foundation models, the markets in which it competes and its competition, its strategies, roadmaps and efforts to develop, market, and sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and its agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. These requests are expected to continue and could be expensive and burdensome.

    Restrictions on hardware, software, and systems used for AI development are being considered or implemented. The EU AI Act, for instance, may impact the company's ability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Similarly, regulations concerning AI technologies at the state level could increase compliance costs. These restrictions could delay or halt deployment of new systems, reduce the number of new entrants, and negatively impact financial results.

    Government actions, such as trade protection, tariffs, and export regulations (including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons), could affect the company's ability to ship products, provide services, and fulfill contractual obligations. Violations of export control laws or sanctions, even without knowledge, could have a material adverse impact. The war in Ukraine has already impacted sales in EMEA, and the increasing focus on AI has led to regulatory restrictions that may further impact product and service offerings. Concerns regarding third-party use of AI could result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products used for training and deploying LLMs. Tighter export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI are increasingly likely, potentially restricting exports to various markets (including China and over 150 countries designated “Tier 2”) and creating a competitive disadvantage. These controls could also impact downstream users of the company's products and disrupt the supply chain.

28. **NAC Process Ineffectiveness:** The Notified Advanced Computing (NAC) process has not resulted in approvals for exports to China.
29. **Disproportionate Impact:** The requirements disproportionately impact NVIDIA, disadvantaging it against competitors who may not be subject to the same restrictions or can acquire licenses.
30. **Long-Term Harm:** The existing export controls have harmed NVIDIA's competitive position, and further changes could exacerbate the situation if customers purchase from competitors, develop internal solutions, or if NVIDIA is unable to provide warranty or service obligations.
31. **License Condition Burdens:** Even if licenses are granted, they may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that NVIDIA or its customers cannot fulfill.
32. **Competitor Benefits:** The licensing requirements may benefit competitors by making NVIDIA's pre- and post-sale technical support more cumbersome, encouraging customers in China to seek alternatives.

**In essence, the U.S. export control regime poses a significant and evolving threat to NVIDIA's business, impacting its ability to compete effectively, serve global markets, and maintain its technological leadership.**


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, focusing on the key risks and challenges faced by NVIDIA, as highlighted in the document. The summary uses a chain-of-thought approach to maintain context and ensure a robust understanding.

**Summary:**

The text outlines several significant risks and challenges NVIDIA faces, primarily stemming from increasing geopolitical tensions, evolving U.S. export controls, Chinese regulations, supply chain dependencies, corporate sustainability pressures, responsible AI usage concerns, and intellectual property protection. These factors collectively threaten NVIDIA's competitive position, financial results, and overall business operations.

*   **U.S. Export Controls:** The U.S. government's export control policies pose a substantial risk. The current licensing process is perceived as opaque, time-consuming, and often results in onerous conditions, even for relatively small systems. This disadvantages NVIDIA against competitors who either aren't subject to the same restrictions or can more easily obtain licenses. Further expansion of these controls – whether geographically (e.g., to the Middle East, Tier 2 countries as defined by the AI Diffusion IFR), by customer, or by product scope – could severely harm NVIDIA. Such changes might lead to customer attrition, the development of in-house solutions by customers, or an inability for NVIDIA to fulfill contractual obligations (warranties, service). License denials or delays can significantly impact key customers. Moreover, burdensome license conditions, such as limitations on large-scale GPU clusters or requirements for chip tracking and throttling mechanisms, could further impede NVIDIA's sales and market access. The expansion of export controls to gaming GPUs could also disrupt NVIDIA's supply chain and negatively affect sales in markets beyond China. This extends to networking products too, as controls on data center GPUs may negatively impact demand for NVIDIA's networking products, and direct controls on networking products themselves could further limit cluster creation for AI model training.

*   **Impact of Export Controls on Competitiveness and Market Dynamics:** The document emphasizes that stringent export controls encourage customers to "design-out" U.S. semiconductors (including NVIDIA's) to mitigate compliance burdens. These controls also incentivize overseas governments to favor non-U.S. suppliers. This dynamic could negatively impact demand for NVIDIA products not only in China but also in other regions like Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. The uncertainty surrounding export controls discourages investment in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, potentially benefiting foreign competitors.

*   **Chinese Regulations:** The Chinese government's actions also present significant risks. Restrictions on gaming activities and increased oversight of digital platforms could adversely affect NVIDIA's Gaming and Data Center revenues, respectively. The government may encourage purchases from domestic competitors or restrict sales to specific customers. Specific examples, like restrictions related to products containing Micron components and the "Action Plan" related to data center accelerator performance, illustrate the potential for Chinese regulations to directly impede NVIDIA's business. If NVIDIA cannot design products that meet the new Chinese standards, customer usage of NVIDIA's data center products might be restricted.

*   **Supply Chain Risks:** NVIDIA's reliance on overseas partners, particularly in Taiwan and South Korea, makes it vulnerable to any new restrictions that disrupt its supply of components, parts, or services from these regions.

*   **Corporate Sustainability and ESG Concerns:** Increased scrutiny regarding NVIDIA's corporate sustainability practices creates additional costs and risks. Failure to meet stakeholder expectations or comply with evolving standards could damage NVIDIA's reputation and relationships with customers and suppliers.

*   **Responsible AI Usage:** Concerns about the responsible use of AI in NVIDIA's products and services present both reputational and financial risks. Controversies related to unintended consequences, copyright infringement, or impacts on human rights, privacy, employment, and social/economic/political issues could harm NVIDIA's brand and lead to legal liability. Additionally, the complexities of complying with multiple AI-related regulations across different jurisdictions, such as the European Union, could increase costs and hinder NVIDIA's ability to offer certain products and services. A failure to adequately address AI concerns could undermine public confidence and slow adoption, further impacting NVIDIA's bottom line.

*   **Intellectual Property (IP) Protection:** Lawsuits alleging patent infringement or other IP violations pose a constant threat. Unfavorable rulings could result in significant damages, invalidation of patents, or injunctive relief. Even meritless claims can be costly to defend and divert resources.

In essence, NVIDIA faces a complex web of external pressures that require careful navigation to maintain its competitive edge and financial stability.

**Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations:**

This section provides an analysis of the company's financial condition and operating results.  It should be read in conjunction with the risk factors ("Item 1A"), the consolidated financial statements and related notes, and other cautionary statements in the 10-K.

*   **Overview:** NVIDIA is described as a pioneer in accelerated computing, initially focused on PC graphics but expanding to scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin applications. The company's two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics." Additional information can be found in Note 16 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
*Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges:*
*Revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions.* Demand for Hopper architecture drove significant growth for the full year. Production systems of the Blackwell architecture began shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.
*Demand estimates for products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in revenue or supply levels. May not be able to generate significant revenue from them.*
*Advancements in accelerated computing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.*
*The company continues to increase supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support demand projections.*

*Product Transitions and New Product Introductions:* Product transitions are complex. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the challenges asso ciated with managing supply and demand which may further create volatility in revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or other costs or result in product delays.

*Global Trade:* In August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that impact exports to China (including Hong Kong)


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, employing chain-of-thought reasoning to maintain context and key details:

**Overall Context:**

The document discusses several factors impacting the company's business and financial results, including product transitions, global trade regulations (specifically US export controls), macroeconomic factors, and geopolitical conflicts. It also provides a summary of the company's financial performance for fiscal year 2025 and highlights critical accounting estimates.

**1. Product Transitions and Associated Challenges:**

*   **Issue:** The company is managing transitions across multiple product architectures (Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive).

    *   Engineering resources are stretched, potentially impacting the development of other products or effective supply chain management.
    *   Customers might delay purchases of existing products or struggle to adopt new products quickly, affecting revenue timing and supply chain costs.
    *   Predicting demand becomes more difficult, impacting supply mix and potentially increasing costs.

**2. Global Trade (US Export Controls):**

*   **Issue:** US government regulations are restricting exports of certain products to China, Russia, and other regions.
*   **Timeline & Scope:**
    *   August 2022: Licensing requirements on A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX systems, etc., to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia.
    *   July 2023: Additional licensing for A100 and H100 to certain customers and regions (including some Middle Eastern countries).
    *   October 2023: New/updated rules effective in Q4 2024 for products exceeding performance thresholds (A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S, RTX 4090) to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel). These rules also apply to entities headquartered in Country Group D5 (including China).
    *   October 23, 2023: Immediate effect for A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S shipments (grace period removed).
    *   Blackwell systems (GB200 NVL 72, NVL 36, and B200) are also subject to these requirements.
    *   The company has not received licenses to ship restricted products to China, and neither have its partners/customers.
    *   January 15, 2025: The USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register . After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Contro l Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology . Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDI A ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or correspon ding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density . Unless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and R TX 6000 Ada.
*   **Response:**
    *   The company expanded its Data Center product portfolio to include solutions not requiring licenses.
    *   They ramped new products specifically designed for China that circumvent export control licenses.
    *   Data Center revenue in China grew in fiscal year 2025 but remains below pre-export control levels as a percentage of total Data Center revenue.
    *   The company will continue to comply with export controls and may seek licenses for customers, but there's no guarantee of approval or timely action.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Existing export controls have harmed the company's competitive position.
    *   Further changes in US export controls could further harm the company's competitive position and future results long-term.
    *   The USG may further restrict a wider range of products, negatively impacting the business and financial results. The company may be unable to sell existing inventory or develop replacement products, potentially excluding them from the China market and other impacted markets.
    *   The USG might restrict imports/sales of products incorporating technologies developed/manufactured in China, potentially affecting automotive solutions.
    *   New export controls could limit alternative manufacturing locations.

**3. Macroeconomic Factors:**

*   **Issue:** Macroeconomic conditions impact the company's operations.
*   **Factors:** Inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, tariffs, and geopolitical developments.
*   **Impact:** Affects supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, capital equipment costs, and the value of investments. Product pricing generally doesn't fluctuate with short-term cost changes. The company continuously manages product availability and costs with its vendors.

**4. Israel and Regional Conflicts:**

*   **Issue:** The geopolitical conflict in and around Israel could impact operations.
*   **Impact:** Monitoring the impact on approximately 4,700 employees in the region, primarily supporting networking products (R&D, operations, sales & marketing). Some employees have been on active military duty, potentially disrupting product development or operations. No significant impact or expense to date, but a further extended or expanded conflict could affect product development, operations, revenue, or create other uncertainty.

**5. Fiscal Year 2025 Summary:**

*   **Revenue:** $130.5 billion, up 114% year-over-year.
*   **Gross Margin:** 75.0%, up 2.3 percentage points.
*   **Operating Expenses:** $16.405 billion, up 45%.
*   **Operating Income:** $81.453 billion, up 147%.
*   **Net Income:** $72.880 billion, up 145%.
*   **Net Income per Diluted Share:** $2.94, up 147%.
*   **Key Drivers:**
    *   Data Center revenue up 142%, driven by Hopper architecture for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI. Blackwell architecture systems began shipping in Q4 2025.
    *   Gaming revenue up 9%, driven by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.
    *   Professional Visualization revenue up 21%, driven by Ada RTX GPU workstations.
    *   Automotive revenue up 55%, driven by self-driving platforms.
    *   Gross margin increased due to a higher mix of Data Center revenue.
    *   Operating expenses increased due to higher compensation, benefits, engineering development, compute and infrastructure costs for new products.

**6. Critical Accounting Estimates:**

*   The preparation of financial statements requires estimates and judgments.
*   Critical areas include inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition.
*   **Inventories:** Cost of sales is charged for inventory provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Provisions are primarily based on excess quantities of products or components, considering inventory levels, future product purchase commitments, demand assumptions, and market conditions. Excess or obsolete inventory or excess purchase commitments can arise from changes in business/economic conditions, market shifts, or sudden demand decreases.

In summary, the document highlights both the company's impressive financial performance and the significant challenges it faces due to rapidly evolving technology, complex geopolitical factors, and global economic uncertainties. The export controls, in particular, pose a substantial risk to its future growth, especially in key markets like China.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, employing chain-of-thought reasoning to maintain context and key details, and aiming for token expansiveness:

**Overall Context:**

This document is part of NVIDIA's financial reporting (specifically, a section from their Annual Report on Form 10-K).  It focuses on key financial aspects of fiscal year 2025 (compared to 2024 and earlier in some cases), including factors influencing revenue, expenses, critical accounting estimates, and segment performance. The document also addresses revenue concentration.

**Key Financial Highlights and Trends:**

*   **Gross Margin Increase:** The gross margin increased in fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue coming from the Data Center segment (a subsegment of Compute & Networking), indicating that this higher-margin business is becoming more dominant.

*   **Operating Expense Increase:** Operating expenses saw a substantial increase (45%) in fiscal year 2025.  This was attributed to:

    *   **Increased Compensation and Benefits:** Higher employee costs due to workforce growth and compensation increases.
    *   **Engineering and Infrastructure Costs:**  Significant investments in engineering development, compute, and infrastructure to support the introduction of new products. This reinforces the narrative that NVIDIA is heavily investing in R&D.

*   **Critical Accounting Estimates:** The company identifies key areas requiring significant estimation and judgment in their financial reporting:

    *   **Inventories:** Provisions are made to write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value. These provisions are influenced by factors like changes in demand, technology obsolescence, new product introductions, and competitive pressures. Unfavorable impact on gross margin from inventory provisions were 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The company uses forecasts and considers manufacturers' lead times to manage inventory and capacity purchase commitments. Lead times can be extensive, sometimes exceeding twelve months, requiring non-cancellable orders and premium payments.
    *   **Income Taxes:** Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on estimates and judgments, taking into account uncertainties in tax law application.  Tax contingencies are recognized based on estimates of potential additional taxes due. Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts believed to be realizable.
    *   **Revenue Recognition:** Sales return allowances are established for products sold with return rights, based on historical return rates.  Customer programs (rebates, marketing development funds) are accounted for as reductions in revenue. For License and Development Arrangements, revenue is recognized over the service period, measuring progress based on actual costs incurred. Contracts may contain multiple performance obligations, generally considered distinct except for License and Development Arrangements. The total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices.

**Segment Performance:**

*   **Compute & Networking:** This segment experienced a significant increase in revenue (+145%) and operating income (+159%). Growth was fueled by strong demand for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Key drivers were:

    *   **Data Center Computing:**  Surged by 162%, driven by demand for the Hopper computing platform, especially for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI.
    *   **Data Center Networking:**  Increased by 51%, boosted by Ethernet for AI revenue, including the Spectrum-X platform.

*   **Graphics:** Revenue increased modestly (+6%), primarily due to sales of GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs. However, operating income *decreased* (-13%) due to a substantial increase in operating expenses (44%), partially offset by the revenue growth.

*   **All Other:** The operating loss increased due to higher stock-based compensation expense, reflecting employee growth and pay increases.

**Revenue Concentration:**

*   NVIDIA has significant direct customers and indirect customers.
*   Direct Customers:  Sales to Direct Customer A represents 12% of total revenue. Sales to Direct Customer B and C each represents 11% of total revenue. These were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. There were no direct customers representing 10% or more of total revenue in fiscal year 2023.
*   Indirect Customers: An indirect customer purchases primarily through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment in fiscal year 2025.
*   NVIDIA acknowledges experiencing periods with significant revenue from a limited number of customers and indicates this trend may persist. Revenue is designated based on the billing location.

**Summary of Key Takeaways:**

NVIDIA's fiscal year 2025 was characterized by strong growth, particularly in the Compute & Networking segment driven by the data center business and AI-related products. While revenue and gross margins improved, operating expenses also increased significantly due to investments in R&D and increased employee costs. The company relies on estimates and judgments in critical accounting areas such as inventory valuation, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Revenue concentration with a few key customers remains a notable aspect of their business.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, employing chain-of-thought reasoning to maintain context and key details:

**Overall Focus:** The text primarily discusses NVIDIA's revenue concentration, gross profit/margin analysis, operating expenses, other income/expenses, income taxes, liquidity and capital resources, and capital return to shareholders for fiscal years 2025 and 2024. It also touches upon outstanding indebtedness, commercial paper programs, and material cash requirements.

**1. Revenue Concentration:**

*   NVIDIA sells products directly to customers (AIBs, distributors, ODMs, OEMs, system integrators) and indirectly (through direct customers) to CSPs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.
*   The company identifies direct customers representing 10% or more of total revenue. In fiscal year 2025, Direct Customer A accounted for 12%, Direct Customer B for 11%, and Direct Customer C for 11% of total revenue. In fiscal year 2024, Direct Customer B accounted for 13% of total revenue. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.
*   One indirect customer, purchasing primarily through system integrators and distributors (including Direct Customer B), is estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue in fiscal year 2025.
*   Revenue concentration with a limited number of customers is a recurring trend for NVIDIA.
*   Revenue by geographic region is based on billing location. Sales outside the United States accounted for 53% and 56% of total revenue in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.

**2. Gross Profit and Gross Margin:**

*   Gross profit is total net revenue less the cost of revenue. The cost of revenue includes semiconductor costs (wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, packaging), board and device costs, manufacturing support, inventory/warranty provisions, memory/component costs, tariffs, shipping, acquisition-related amortization, license and development costs, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation for manufacturing personnel.
*   Gross margins increased from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024 to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025, primarily driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.
*   Provisions for inventory and excess purchase obligations were $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2025 and $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2024.
*   The release of these provisions was $689 million and $540 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.
*   The net effect of these provisions was an unfavorable impact on gross margin of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024.

**3. Operating Expenses:**

*   Operating expenses are categorized into Research and Development (R&D) and Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A).
*   R&D expenses increased significantly in fiscal year 2025, driven by increased compensation and benefits (including stock-based compensation due to employee growth), a substantial increase in compute and infrastructure costs, and a large increase in engineering development costs for new product introductions. R&D expenses were $12.914 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared to $8.675 billion in fiscal year 2024.
*   SG&A expenses also increased in fiscal year 2025, primarily due to compensation and benefits (including stock-based compensation) reflecting employee growth and compensation increases. SG&A expenses were $3.491 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared to $2.654 billion in fiscal year 2024.

**4. Other Income (Expense), Net:**

*   This category includes interest income, interest expense, and other items (gains/losses from investments and foreign currency fluctuations).
*   Interest income increased due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.
*   The "Other, net" component increased significantly, driven by changes in the fair value of non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities.

**5. Income Taxes:**

*   Income tax expense was $11.1 billion for fiscal year 2025 and $4.1 billion for fiscal year 2024.
*   The effective tax rate increased primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a prior year discrete benefit due to an audit resolution.
*   The effective tax rates were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate due to benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit, and income earned in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. There is potential for a future release of a valuation allowance related to certain state deferred tax assets, which would decrease income tax expense.

**6. Liquidity and Capital Resources:**

*   NVIDIA's liquidity sources are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations.
*   Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $43.2 billion as of January 26, 2025, compared to $25.984 billion as of January 28, 2024.
*   Cash from operating activities increased due to revenue growth. Cash used in investing activities increased primarily due to net purchases of marketable securities and purchases of land, property, and equipment. Cash used in financing activities increased due to higher share repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.
*   The company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future.
*   Most cash held outside the U.S. is available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional federal income taxes, except for approximately $1.7 billion.

**7. Capital Return to Shareholders:**

*   The Board authorized an additional $50 billion for share repurchases.
*   NVIDIA repurchased 310 million shares for $34.0 billion in fiscal year 2025.
*   As of January 26, 2025, $38.7 billion remained authorized for repurchases.
*   From January 27, 2025, through February 21, 2025, an additional 29 million shares were repurchased for $3.7 billion.
*   The share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from employee stock issuances.
*   Cash dividends of $834 million were paid in fiscal year 2025.
*   The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's 1% excise tax on share repurchases was not material.

**8. Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program:**

*   The company's debt maturities are detailed by year, with a net long-term carrying amount of $8.463 billion.
*   NVIDIA has a $575 million commercial paper program, but no commercial paper was outstanding as of January 26, 2025.

**9. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations:**

*   Capital expenditures were $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 and $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2024 and are expected to increase in fiscal year 2026.
*   Unrecognized tax benefits totaled $2.2 billion at the end of fiscal year 2025.

In summary, NVIDIA experienced substantial growth in revenue, gross profit, and operating expenses in fiscal year 2025. Increased data center revenue drove gross margin improvements.  The company is actively returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, while also investing heavily in R&D and infrastructure to support future growth. They maintain a strong liquidity position.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to maintain context and key details, and aiming for robustness and token expansiveness where appropriate.

**Overall Context:**

This excerpt appears to be from NVIDIA's Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year 2025 (ending January 26, 2025). It covers various aspects of the company's financial condition, obligations, market risks, controls and procedures, and corporate governance. The text references multiple "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements" (specifically Notes 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 17), indicating that further details are available in those sections of the report.

**Detailed Summary by Section:**

1.  **Outstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program:**

    *   NVIDIA details its debt maturity schedule as of January 26, 2025.  The debt is categorized by the year in which it is payable.
    *   Specifically, it lists debt due in one to five years ($2,250 million), five to ten years ($2,750 million), and greater than ten years ($3,500 million).
    *   The unamortized debt discount and issuance costs are ($37) million.
    *   The net long-term carrying amount is $8,463 million.
    *   NVIDIA maintains a $575 million commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, but as of January 26, 2025, there was no commercial paper outstanding.

2.  **Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations:**

    *   The document refers the reader to specific notes (11, 12, and 17) for a detailed description of long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, respectively.
    *   NVIDIA reports capital expenditures of $3.4 billion in fiscal year 2025 and $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2024. They expect to increase capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026 to support future growth. This indicates planned expansion and investment.
    *   The company has unrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, including $251 million in related interest and penalties, recorded as non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2025. The timing of the potential tax liability is uncertain. More details are in Note 13.

3.  **Climate Change:**

    *   To date, global sustainability regulations, sourcing renewable energy, or climate-related business trends have not had a material impact on NVIDIA's results of operations.

4.  **Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:**

    *   Details about the adoption of new accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 1.

5.  **Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk:**

    *   **Investment and Interest Rate Risk:** NVIDIA acknowledges exposure to interest rate risk related to its fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. A sensitivity analysis shows that a +/- 0.5% parallel shift in the yield curve would change the fair value of investments by $238 million. Because the notes bear a fixed rate, the company has no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Further information is available in Note 11.
    *   **Foreign Exchange Rate Risk:** NVIDIA considers its direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal because most sales are in U.S. dollars, and they use foreign currency forward contracts to offset exchange rate movements. However, they acknowledge that a stronger U.S. dollar could make their products more expensive and a weaker dollar could increase supplier costs. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $136 million lower amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign exchange contracts as of January 26, 2025, compared to $116 million on January 28, 2024. An adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change would have resulted in a $129 million and $60 million adverse impact on income before taxes as of January 26, 2025, and January 28, 2024, respectively, offset by changes in the values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Note 10 contains additional details.

6.  **Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:**

    *   This section simply states that the required financial information is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes within the 10-K.

7.  **Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure:**

    *   There were no changes in or disagreements with accountants.

    *   NVIDIA's management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that their disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 26, 2025, providing reasonable assurance that information is accurately and timely reported.
    *   Management also concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 26, 2025, based on the COSO framework. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP audited and attested to the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
    *   There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended January 26, 2025, that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. NVIDIA is in the process of upgrading its ERP system.
    *   The company acknowledges the inherent limitations of control systems, noting that they cannot prevent all errors or fraud and that the design of controls must consider resource constraints.

9.  **Item 9B. Other Information:**

    *   This section details Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (plans allowing insiders to trade company stock at predetermined times and prices) adopted, modified, or terminated by certain directors and officers.
    *   Aarti Shah (Director) terminated a plan on November 25, 2024, and adopted a new one on the same date.
    *   John O. Dabiri (Director) adopted a plan on December 9, 2024.

10. **Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections**

    *   Not applicable.

11. **Part III (Items 10 onwards):**

    *   Certain information required by Part III of the 10-K (related to directors, executive officers, corporate governance, etc.) is omitted and will be included in NVIDIA's 2025 Proxy Statement, which will be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the end of fiscal year 2025. Specific information is incorporated by reference to sections within the future Proxy Statement. The Code of Conduct and Financial Team Code of Conduct are published on the Investor Relations portion of NVIDIA's website. Amendments or waivers to either code will be promptly disclosed.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   NVIDIA has a significant amount of long-term debt, but no immediate commercial paper obligations.

This summary aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the provided text, maintaining the context and key details while explaining the relationships between the different sections.


Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the provided text, incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning to preserve context and key details, while expanding on the token count for thoroughness.

**Overall Context:**

The provided text appears to be an excerpt from NVIDIA Corporation's financial statements and the accompanying auditor's report. It covers several key areas: the auditor's opinion regarding inventory valuation, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, balance sheets, shareholder equity, and cash flow, and a segment from the notes to the consolidated financial statements focusing on organization and significant accounting policies. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP served as the company's auditor since 2004.

**Auditor's Opinion on Critical Audit Matter - Valuation of Inventories:**

The auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, addresses the valuation of inventories as a critical audit matter.  While issuing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, they are *not* providing a separate opinion on this specific matter or the related accounts/disclosures. The critical audit matter pertains to "Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments."

*   **Key Details:** The company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down inventory related to excess or obsolete stock and excess product purchase commitments.  A significant portion of these provisions relates to excess product quantities, based on comparisons between inventory levels/future purchase commitments and assumptions about future demand/market conditions. As of January 26, 2025, NVIDIA's consolidated inventories were $10.1 billion, and outstanding purchase obligations were $30.8 billion, a significant portion tied to inventory.
*   **Why it's Critical:** The auditor identified this area as critical due to the significant judgment involved by NVIDIA's management in developing these inventory provisions.  This judgment extends to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Consequently, the audit required significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort to evaluate management's assumptions.
*   **Audit Procedures:**  Addressing this matter involved testing the effectiveness of controls over management's provisions, including controls over assumptions about demand and market conditions.  Specific procedures included:

    *   Testing management's process for developing the provisions.
    *   Evaluating the appropriateness of management's approach.
    *   Testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used.
    *   Evaluating the reasonableness of management's assumptions.

*   **Assumption Evaluation:** Evaluating management's demand/market condition assumptions involved considering:

    *   Current and past results, including historical product lifecycles.
    *   Consistency with external market and industry data.
    *   Changes in technology.

**Consolidated Financial Statements Summary:**

*   **Consolidated Statements of Income:**
    *   **Revenue:**  NVIDIA experienced substantial revenue growth. Revenue for the year ended January 26, 2025, was $130.497 billion, compared to $60.922 billion in 2024 and $26.974 billion in 2023.
    *   **Net Income:** Net income also increased significantly, reaching $72.880 billion in 2025, compared to $29.760 billion in 2024 and $4.368 billion in 2023.
*   **Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income:**
    *   NVIDIA reports both net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income primarily relates to changes in unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale securities and cash flow hedges.
*   **Consolidated Balance Sheets:**
    *   **Total Assets:** NVIDIA's total assets increased significantly, from $65.728 billion in 2024 to $111.601 billion in 2025. This increase is fueled by rises in cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable and inventories.
    *   **Inventories:** Inventories increased substantially, from $5.282 billion in 2024 to $10.080 billion in 2025, which ties directly into the auditor's critical audit matter discussion.
    *   **Total Liabilities and Shareholder's Equity:** NVIDIA's total liabilities and shareholder's equity increased from $65.728 billion to $111.601 billion.
*   **Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity:**
    *   The statement shows changes in common stock, additional paid-in capital, accumulated other comprehensive income, and retained earnings. Key changes include net income, other comprehensive income, issuance of common stock, tax withholding related to vesting of restricted stock units, share repurchases, cash dividends, and stock-based compensation.
*   **Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:**
    *   **Operating Activities:**  Net cash provided by operating activities was $64.089 billion in 2025, $28.090 billion in 2024, and $5.641 billion in 2023.
    *   **Investing Activities:**  Investing activities resulted in a net cash *outflow* of $20.421 billion in 2025. This was primary due to purchases of marketable securities, property and equipment, and non-marketable equity securities.
    *   **Financing Activities:**  Financing activities resulted in a net cash *outflow* of $42.359 billion in 2025, primarily due to repurchases of common stock.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:**

*   **Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:**
    *   NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
    *   Fiscal years operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January.

    *   NVIDIA derives its revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services.

**In conclusion,** the provided text highlights NVIDIA's significant financial growth, particularly in revenue and net income. The auditor's emphasis on inventory valuation as a critical audit matter underscores the importance of management's judgment and assumptions related to future demand and market conditions in this rapidly evolving technology sector. The consolidated financial statements provide a detailed overview of NVIDIA's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements provide context related to how these financials are being prepared.


NVIDIA, incorporated in California in 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1998, prepares its consolidated financial statements, including NVIDIA Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requiring management to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect reported amounts. A ten-for-one stock split was executed in June 2024, with all share-related information retroactively adjusted. NVIDIA operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were 52-week years. All intercompany transactions are eliminated during consolidation.

Revenue is derived from product sales (hardware and systems), license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services, recognized using a five-step process: (1) identifying the contract, (2) identifying performance obligations, (3) determining the transaction price, (4) allocating the price to obligations, and (5) recognizing revenue as obligations are met. Product sales revenue is recognized upon transfer of control, net of allowances for returns, customer programs (rebates and MDFs), and taxes. Sales return allowances are established based on historical return rates, adjusted for anticipated changes. Customer programs are accounted for as a reduction to revenue.

License and development arrangements, involving significant IP customization, recognize revenue from both license and services as a single performance obligation over the service period, measured by the cost-to-cost method. Software licenses, offering either perpetual or subscription rights, recognize revenue upfront when the software is available, while support revenue is recognized ratably. Cloud services, provided on a subscription or usage basis, recognize revenue ratably over the contract period or as usage occurs.

Contracts with multiple performance obligations allocate the transaction price to each obligation based on relative standalone selling prices, maximizing the use of observable inputs. Product warranties, typically one to three years, cover manufacturing defects, with costs estimated at revenue recognition.

Stock-based compensation for RSUs and PSUs is based on the closing stock price on the grant date (minus dividend yield for RSUs), and fair value is estimated using Monte Carlo simulations for market-based PSUs. Expense recognition varies by award type, with RSUs and market-based PSUs using straight-line attribution and PSUs using accelerated amortization based on performance targets. ESPP shares are valued using the Black-Scholes model, expensed using accelerated amortization. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical data.

NVIDIA is subject to ongoing litigation and investigations, with potential for material losses. Losses are recorded when probable and reasonably estimable. Foreign currency remeasurement uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency; gains or losses are included in earnings.

Income taxes are recognized based on estimated current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, with a valuation allowance reducing deferred tax assets if realization is uncertain. Estimates involve judgments and uncertainties related to tax laws. Liabilities are recognized for potential tax contingencies. As of January 26, 2025, NVIDIA had a $1.6 billion valuation allowance related to capital loss carryforwards and certain state deferred tax assets. A tax position's benefit is recognized only if it's more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, employing chain-of-thought reasoning to capture the key accounting policies and estimates discussed.

**Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities:**

*   **Core Principle:** The company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimated future tax effects related to temporary differences and carryforwards across various jurisdictions (federal, state, foreign).
*   **Valuation Allowance:** A crucial aspect is the valuation allowance.  This allowance reduces deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence and judgment, the company believes those assets won't be realized. This is a conservative approach.
*   **Estimation and Judgment:** Calculating deferred tax assets/liabilities involves estimates and judgments, particularly when navigating complex tax laws. These estimates are subject to change.
*   **Factors Affecting Estimates:** Changes can occur due to increased certainty about outcomes (e.g., audit results), changes in accounting standards or tax laws (in the US or foreign countries), or alterations in other relevant circumstances.
*   **Tax Contingencies:** Liabilities are also recognized for potential income tax contingencies (US and foreign). These are based on estimates of whether additional taxes might be due.
*   **Adjustments:** If the company determines that a tax payment isn't necessary or that the recorded liability is too low, adjustments (income tax benefit or expense) are made in the financial statements.
*   **Specific Example:** As of January 26, 2025, a \$1.6 billion valuation allowance existed, primarily related to capital loss carryforwards and some state/other deferred tax assets. Management didn't expect these to be realized, partly due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income and capital gains.
*   **Potential Reversal:** If the realization of these deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not, they will be recognized as income tax benefits.
*   **Tax Position Recognition:** The company only recognizes the benefit from a tax position if it is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on technical merits.
*   **Interest and Penalties:** Interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits are treated as a component of income tax expense.

**Net Income Per Share:**

*   **Basic EPS:** Calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period.
*   **Diluted EPS:** Calculated using the weighted average number of common shares and *potentially* dilutive shares outstanding, employing the treasury stock method.
*   **Anti-dilutive Effects:**  Any anti-dilutive effects of equity awards are *not* included in the diluted EPS calculation.

**Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities:**

*   **Cash Equivalents:** Highly liquid investments readily convertible to cash, with an original maturity of three months or less at purchase.
*   **Marketable Securities:** Highly liquid *debt* investments with maturities exceeding three months at purchase *and* publicly-held equity securities.
*   **Classification:**  These are classified as current assets, based on their nature and availability for current operations.
*   **Available-for-Sale:** Cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale at acquisition.
*   **Fair Value:**  Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains/losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss (a component of shareholders' equity), net of tax. Accrued interest is included in the fair value.
*   **Realized Gains/Losses:** Gains/losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and reported in "Other income (expense), net."
*    **Impairment Review**: Available-for-sale securities are subject to impairment review. If fair value is less than amortized cost, the company determines if the difference is due to expected credit losses and writes down the amortized cost basis if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis.
*   **Credit Losses:** Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in "Other income (expense), net."
*   **Publicly Held Equity Securities:** Changes in fair value are recorded in "Other income (expense), net."

**Fair Value of Financial Instruments:**

*   **Short-Term Assets/Liabilities:** Carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to short maturities as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024.
*   **Marketable Securities:** Reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.
*   **Derivatives:** Recognized as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value.
*   **Hedge Accounting:** The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on their intended use and designation. Fair value hedges recognize gains or losses in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges initially report the effective portion of gains or losses as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and are subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivatives not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.

**Concentration of Credit Risk:**

*   **Financial Instruments:** Primarily cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable.
*   **Risk Management:** Investment policy mandates high-rated fixed income securities, diversification, and limits on portfolio maturities.
*   **Customer Credit Evaluation:** Ongoing credit evaluations of customers are performed, and an allowance for potential credit losses is maintained. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit are excluded from overall exposure.

**Inventories:**

*   **Cost Basis:** Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis.
*   **Cost Components:** Includes semiconductor costs (wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, packaging), manufacturing support, final test yield fallout, shipping costs, purchased memory, and other component parts.
*   **Inventory Provisions:** Cost of sales is charged for inventory provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, or for obsolete/excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments.
*   **Excess Quantities:**  Most provisions relate to excess product quantities, based on inventory levels, future purchase commitments, and assumptions about future demand/market conditions.
*   **New Cost Basis:**  Once inventory is written off or down, it establishes a new cost basis.
*   **Purchase Commitments:** A liability is recorded for non-cancelable purchase commitments exceeding future demand forecasts, consistent with the valuation of obsolete/excess inventory.

**Property and Equipment:**

*   **Valuation:** Stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
*   **Depreciation Method:** Straight-line method is used, based on estimated useful lives (2-7 years, up to 30 years for buildings).
*   **Retirement/Disposition:** Cost and accumulated depreciation are removed, and a gain/loss is recorded.
*   **Leasehold Improvements/Finance Leases:** Amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the asset's useful life.

**Leases:**

*   **Determination:** The company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception.
*   **Operating Leases:** Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.
*   **Asset and Liability Recognition:** Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
*   **Asset and Liability Valuation:** Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives.
*   **Lease Terms:** Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
*   **Expense Recognition:** Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Goodwill:**

*   **Impairment Testing:** Subject to annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter or earlier if indicators exist.
*   **Analysis:** Qualitative or quantitative analysis is performed on a reporting unit basis.
*   **Qualitative Factors:** Include industry/market considerations, financial performance, and other events.
*   **Quantitative Test:** Considers both income and market approaches to estimate fair value.
*   **Valuation Factors:** Prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates, comparable multiples.  These require assumptions and estimates about industry economic factors and future profitability.

**Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets:**

*   **Intangible Assets:** Primarily acquired intangible assets, including developed technology, customer relationships, rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired IP.
*   **Amortization:** Amortized over periods ranging from 1-20 years, reflecting the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, or using a straight-line method if the pattern cannot be reliably determined.
*   **Impairment Review:** Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
*   **Recoverability:** Measured by comparing the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows.
*   **Impairment Charge:** Recognized if the carrying amount exceeds estimated future cash flows. Fair value is determined based on discounted future cash flows.
*   **Disposal:** Assets/liabilities to be disposed of are presented separately, and assets are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.

**Business Combinations:**

*   **Purchase Price Allocation:** The fair value of the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values.
*   **Goodwill Calculation:** The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill.
*   **Estimates and Assumptions:** Management's estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain.
*   **Valuation Inputs:** The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives.

This summary aims to capture the essential details of the accounting policies, the estimations involved, and the potential impacts on the company's financial statements.


This excerpt from NVIDIA Corporation's financial statements provides details on asset valuation, business combinations, non-marketable equity securities, recent accounting pronouncements, the termination of the Arm share purchase agreement, and stock-based compensation. Here's a breakdown:

**Asset Valuation and Impairment:**

*   **Recoverability of Assets:** NVIDIA assesses the recoverability of assets or asset groups by comparing their carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows they are expected to generate.
*   **Impairment Charge:** If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized. This charge is the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows.
*   **Assets for Disposal:** Assets and liabilities slated for disposal are presented separately on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. These assets are no longer depreciated.

**Business Combinations:**

*   **Purchase Price Allocation:** When NVIDIA acquires a business, it allocates the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values.
*   **Goodwill:** The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
*   **Fair Value Estimates:** Management's fair value estimates rely on assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain.
*   **Measurement Period:** Adjustments to asset and liability values can be made during a measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date), with corresponding adjustments to goodwill. Subsequent adjustments are recorded in the income statement.
*   **Acquisition-Related Expenses:** These expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

**Non-Marketable Equity Securities:**

*   **Valuation:** Investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, adjusted for observable price changes in similar transactions.
*   **Fair Value Determination:** Fair value is based on observable inputs in inactive markets, requiring judgment due to the absence of market prices and liquidity.
*   **Gains and Losses:** Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are recognized in other income (expense), net, on the income statement.
*   **Impairment Assessment:** NVIDIA assesses impairment based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If impairment is identified, the investment is written down to fair value, with a corresponding charge to other income (expense), net.

**Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:**

*   **Recently Adopted:** In November 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of significant expenses in operating segments. NVIDIA adopted this standard in its fiscal year 2025 annual report.
*   **Not Yet Adopted:**
    *   In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which includes new and updated income tax disclosures. NVIDIA expects to adopt this standard in its fiscal year 2026 annual report and does not expect it to have a material impact, other than additional disclosures.
    *   In November 2024, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring disclosures of certain additional expense information on an annual and interim basis. NVIDIA expects to adopt this standard in its fiscal year 2028 annual report and does not expect it to have a material impact, other than additional disclosures.

**Termination of Arm Share Purchase Agreement:**

Okay, here is a detailed summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to preserve context and key details:

**Overall Context:**

The text is an excerpt from NVIDIA Corporation's financial statements, specifically the "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements." These notes provide supplementary information and detailed breakdowns of various line items presented in the main financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, etc.). The notes cover equity awards, net income per share, goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, cash equivalents and marketable securities, fair value measurements, balance sheet components. The reporting periods primarily focus on the years ended January 26, 2025, January 28, 2024, and sometimes January 29, 2023, allowing for year-over-year comparisons.

**Key Details by Note:**

*   **Equity Award Activity:** As of January 26, 2025, NVIDIA had 2.2 billion shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan. The balance of outstanding RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs decreased from 367 million shares on January 28, 2024, to 274 million shares on January 26, 2025. This change is attributed to grants, vesting, cancellations, and forfeitures. The weighted average grant-date fair value per share increased from $24.59 to $44.75. Shares available for future grants decreased from 1.5 billion to 1.4 billion. The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs vesting increased significantly year-over-year, from $4.3 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $8.2 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $15.1 billion in fiscal year 2025.

*   **Net Income Per Share:** NVIDIA provides a reconciliation of the basic and diluted net income per share calculations. Net income increased substantially across the periods, from $4.368 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $29.760 billion in fiscal year 2024 to $72.880 billion in fiscal year 2025. This drove significant increases in both basic and diluted net income per share. Basic EPS increased from $0.18 to $1.21 to $2.97, while diluted EPS increased from $0.17 to $1.19 to $2.94.

*   **Goodwill:** The total carrying amount of goodwill increased from $4.4 billion as of January 28, 2024, to $5.2 billion as of January 26, 2025. The increase of $758 million is attributed to acquisitions and was allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit. Both Compute & Networking and Graphics reporting units have goodwill allocated to them ($4.8 billion and $370 million respectively in 2025). Annual qualitative impairment tests concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of the reported years.

*   **Amortizable Intangible Assets:** The breakdown of intangible assets (acquisition-related and patents/licensed technology) is provided, showing gross carrying amount, accumulated amortization, and net carrying amount. The net carrying amount decreased from $1.112 billion in 2024 to $807 million in 2025. Amortization expense decreased from $699 million in fiscal year 2023 to $614 million in fiscal year 2024 to $593 million in fiscal year 2025. A table outlines the estimated future amortization expense for the coming years, totaling $807 million.

*   **Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities:** A detailed summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities is presented, categorized by type (corporate debt, U.S. Treasury, money market funds, etc.). The total fair value increased significantly from $25.724 billion in 2024 to $42.487 billion in 2025. The split between cash equivalents and marketable securities is also provided. Publicly-held equity securities from investments in non-affiliated entities, previously included in other assets (long term), were classified in marketable securities beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Net unrealized and realized gains on publicly-held equity securities are reported, with fiscal year 2025 showing significant activity. The tables also breakdown unrealized losses by investment category and the length of time the securities have been in a continuous loss position. Finally, the amortized cost and estimated fair value are shown by contractual maturity (less than one year, and due in 1-5 years).

*   **Fair Value of Financial Assets/Liabilities and Non-Marketable Equity Securities:** Fair values are determined using market prices. Assets and liabilities are classified into Levels 1 or 2 based on the availability of quoted market prices. Money market funds and publicly-held equity securities are classified as Level 1, while other debt securities and notes payable are classified as Level 2. Adjustments to non-marketable equity securities are detailed, showing net additions, unrealized gains, and impairments/unrealized losses. Non-marketable equity securities had cumulative gross unrealized gains of $1.1 billion and cumulative gross unrealized losses and impairments of $105 million as of January 26, 2025.

*   **Balance Sheet Components:** NVIDIA identifies its direct customers. Two direct customers accounted for 17% and 16% of the accounts receivable balance as of January 26, 2025, and 24% and 11% as of January 28, 2024. Inventories are broken down into raw materials, work in process, and finished goods. Total inventories significantly increased from $5.282 billion to $10.080 billion. Inventory provisions also increased from $774 million to $1.6 billion. Property and equipment are detailed, showing land, buildings, equipment, construction in process, accumulated depreciation, and net property and equipment. Total net property and equipment increased from $3.914 billion to $6.283 billion.

This summary provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the information presented in the provided text, maintaining context and preserving key details from the financial statement notes.


Okay, here is a detailed and token-expansive summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to preserve context and key details:

**1. Warranty Liabilities:**

*   **Overview:** NVIDIA provides product warranties, resulting in liabilities that represent the estimated costs to cover warranty claims.
*   **Liability Amounts:** The estimated product warranty liability was $1.3 billion as of January 26, 2025, a substantial increase from $306 million on January 28, 2024.
*   **Warranty Activity:**
    *   The beginning balance of the warranty liability was $306 million in fiscal year 2025, $82 million in fiscal year 2024, and $46 million in fiscal year 2023.
    *   Additions to the liability were $1.203 billion in 2025, $278 million in 2024 and $145 million in 2023
    *   Utilization of the liability (i.e., actual warranty costs incurred) was $219 million in 2025, $54 million in 2024, and $109 million in 2023.
    *   The ending balance for these periods was $1.290 billion in 2025, $306 million in 2024 and $82 million in 2023.
*   **Segment Association:**  The increases in product warranty liabilities in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment.
*   **Indemnities:** NVIDIA provides indemnities for tax, product, and employee liabilities and includes intellectual property indemnification in technology agreements.  The maximum potential future payments related to these indemnities cannot be reasonably estimated due to the lack of stated maximum liabilities in many agreements, and no liabilities have been recorded in the financial statements for these indemnifications.

**2. Litigation (Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits):**

*   **Securities Class Action Lawsuit (In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation):**
    *   **Background:**  A securities class action lawsuit was filed against NVIDIA, alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act related to materially false or misleading statements about channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 2017 and November 2018. The plaintiffs sought unspecified compensatory damages, costs, and fees.
    *   **Initial Dismissal and Appeal:** The district court initially dismissed the complaint in March 2021.  The plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit.
    *   **Ninth Circuit Ruling:** In August 2023, the Ninth Circuit partially reversed the dismissal, leading NVIDIA to petition for a rehearing en banc, which was denied.
    *   **Supreme Court Involvement:**  NVIDIA then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. However, the Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the writ as improvidently granted in December 2024, issuing a judgment in January 2025.
    *   **Remand:** As a result, in February 2025, the Ninth Circuit's judgment took effect, and the case was sent back to the district court for further proceedings.
*   **Derivative Lawsuits:**
    *   **Northern District of California Derivative Lawsuit (In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation):** This lawsuit was stayed pending the resolution of the securities class action.  Although administratively closed in February 2022, it is expected to be reopened now that the securities litigation appeal is resolved. The lawsuit makes claims against certain NVIDIA officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of the Exchange Act, based on similar allegations to the securities class action. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and corporate governance reforms.
    *   **Delaware Derivative Lawsuits (Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. and Nelson v. Huang, et. al.):** These derivative actions, filed in Delaware, were also stayed pending the resolution of the securities litigation appeal.  The stay was extended for 30 days on February 5, 2025, to allow the parties to discuss next steps. These lawsuits allege breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste, and violations of the Exchange Act, again based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, disgorgement of profits, and corporate governance measures.
    *   **Delaware Chancery Court Derivative Action (Horanic v. Huang, et al.):** This lawsuit, filed in October 2023, is also stayed pending the final resolution of the securities litigation. It asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on similar allegations and seeks unspecified damages, disgorgement of profits, and reform of corporate governance.
*   **Accounting for Loss Contingencies:** As of January 26, 2025, NVIDIA has not accrued any contingent liabilities for these legal proceedings because, while possible, liabilities are not deemed probable, and any potential loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. NVIDIA is also involved in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, but it believes the ultimate outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its financials.

**3. Income Taxes:**

*   **Income Tax Expense (Benefit):** The income tax expense was $11.146 billion for the year ended January 26, 2025, $4.058 billion for the year ended January 28, 2024, and a benefit of $(187) million for the year ended January 29, 2023.
*   **Components of Income Tax:** The income tax expense consists of current and deferred components, at the federal, state, and foreign levels.
    *   Current income taxes were $15.623 billion in 2025, $6.547 billion in 2024 and $1.977 billion in 2023.
        *   Federal current income taxes were $14.032 billion in 2025, $5.710 billion in 2024 and $1.703 billion in 2023.

        *    Federal deferred income taxes were $(4.515) billion in 2025, $(2.499) billion in 2024 and $(2.165) billion in 2023.
        *   State deferred income taxes were $(242) million in 2025, $(206) million in 2024 and $0 million in 2023.
        *   Foreign deferred income taxes were $280 million in 2025, $216 million in 2024 and $1 million in 2023.
*   **Income Before Income Tax:** Income before income tax was $84.026 billion in 2025, $33.818 billion in 2024 and $4.181 billion in 2023.
    *   U.S. income before income tax was $77.456 billion in 2025, $29.495 billion in 2024 and $3.477 billion in 2023.
    *   Foreign income before income tax was $6.570 billion in 2025, $4.323 billion in 2024 and $704 million in 2023.
*   **Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation:**  The income tax expense differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to factors such as:
    *   State income taxes (net of federal tax effect).
    *   Foreign-derived intangible income (FDII).
    *   Stock-based compensation.
    *   U.S. federal research and development (R&D) tax credit.
    *   Foreign tax rate differentials.
    *   Acquisition termination cost.
*   **Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities:**
    *   Significant deferred tax assets include capitalized R&D expenditure, GILTI deferred tax assets, accruals and reserves, research and other tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss (NOL) and capital loss carryforwards, operating lease liabilities, stock-based compensation, and property, equipment, and intangible assets.
    *   Significant deferred tax liabilities include unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, operating lease assets, equity investments, and acquired intangibles.
    *   As of January 26, 2025, total deferred tax assets were $11.604 billion and total deferred tax liabilities were $1.511 billion, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $10.093 billion.
*   **Undistributed Earnings:** NVIDIA intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.4 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries. The unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to these investments have not been determined because it is not practicable to do so.
*   **Valuation Allowance:**  NVIDIA has a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion related to capital loss carryforwards and certain state and other deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized.  The company may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease income tax expense.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the warranty liabilities, legal proceedings, and income tax details presented in the original document, maintaining context and important numerical data.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to maintain context and key details:

**Overall Context:** The provided text represents excerpts from NVIDIA Corporation's financial statements, specifically focusing on tax-related information, shareholders' equity, employee retirement plans, and segment reporting. It provides details for fiscal years 2023, 2024, and 2025, ending January 29, 2023, January 28, 2024, and January 26, 2025, respectively.

**1. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities:**

*   NVIDIA has a net deferred tax asset. The net deferred tax asset was $10.093 billion in 2025 and $5.617 billion in 2024.
*   This asset includes long-term deferred tax assets ($11 billion in 2025 and $6.1 billion in 2024) and long-term deferred tax liabilities ($886 million in 2025 and $462 million in 2024).
*   The company intends to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.4 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by certain subsidiaries. They haven't provided unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to these investments because determining the amount isn't practicable.

**2. Valuation Allowance:**

*   NVIDIA had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion as of both January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024. This allowance relates to capital loss carryforwards and certain state and other deferred tax assets.
*   Management believes these assets are not likely to be realized, partly due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains.
*   If realization becomes more likely, the deferred tax assets would be recognized as income tax benefits.
*   The company believes it may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease income tax expense. The timing and amount could vary.

**3. Net Operating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforwards:**

*   As of January 26, 2025, NVIDIA had U.S. federal ($479 million), state ($332 million), and foreign ($349 million) net operating loss carryforwards.
*   Federal and state carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, respectively.
*   Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $349 million may be carried forward indefinitely.
*   The company had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $46 million (expiring in fiscal year 2026) and state research tax credit carryforwards of $1.5 billion. Of the state credits, $1.4 billion is attributable to California (carried over indefinitely), and $98 million is attributable to other states (expiring in fiscal year 2026).
*   They also had federal capital loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion expiring in fiscal year 2028.

**4. Tax Attributes and Unrecognized Tax Benefits:**

*   NVIDIA's tax attributes are subject to audit and potential adjustment due to changes in tax laws.
*   Utilization of tax attributes may be limited due to ownership changes or other provisions.
*   A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is provided for 2023, 2024, and 2025, showing balances at the beginning and end of each period, increases, decreases, lapses, and settlements. The balance at the end of 2025 was $2.861 billion.
*   $2 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits as of January 26, 2025, would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.
*   Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current or long-term liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash payment or receipt.
*   Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in income tax expense. NVIDIA recognized $92 million, $42 million, and $33 million in interest and penalties during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
*   As of January 26, 2025, and January 28, 2024, accruals for payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were $251 million and $140 million, respectively.
*   The company believes it has adequately provided for all tax positions, but amounts asserted by tax authorities could differ. No positions were identified for which unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.
*   Significant tax jurisdictions subject to examination include the U.S. (after 2021) and several international locations (2014-2024). Current examinations are underway in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Taiwan and California.

Okay, here's a comprehensive summary of the provided text, focusing on key details and context, using chain-of-thought reasoning to explain the implications of different sections.

**Overall Purpose and Context:**

The text describes provisions related to corporate governance, indemnification, and equity compensation at NVIDIA Corporation. It includes details about potential anti-takeover measures, director liability limitations, the company's transfer agent, and the terms and conditions of a Global Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) award granted under the company's 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.

**Key Areas and Detailed Summaries:**

1.  **Anti-Takeover Provisions (DGCL Section 203):**

    *   The text explains that NVIDIA is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL).
    *   **Reasoning:** Section 203 is an anti-takeover statute. It aims to prevent hostile takeovers by restricting "business combinations" with "interested stockholders" for three years after the stockholder achieves that status.
    *   **Key Details:**
        *   A "business combination" includes mergers, significant asset sales (10% or more), stock issuances to the interested stockholder, and disproportionately benefiting the interested stockholder.
        *   An "interested stockholder" is defined as someone who owns (or within the last three years owned) 15% or more of the company's voting stock, or any entity affiliated with that person.
        *   **Exceptions:** The three-year restriction doesn't apply if:
            *   The board approved the combination or the transaction making the stockholder "interested" *before* it happened.
            *   The interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock *excluding* shares held by director-officers and employee stock plans where employees can't confidentially decide whether to tender shares.
            *   The board *and* at least 66 2/3% of the *disinterested* outstanding voting stock (excluding the interested stockholder's shares) approve the business combination.
    *   **Implications:** Section 203 makes it significantly more difficult for an investor to acquire NVIDIA against the wishes of the board and management. It requires either overwhelming shareholder support (66 2/3% of disinterested shares) or prior board approval. This protects the company from unsolicited takeover bids but could also entrench management.

2.  **Indemnification of Directors and Officers:**

    *   **Summary:** NVIDIA's bylaws mandate indemnification of directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. The company is also empowered to indemnify other officers, employees and agents, enter into indemnification contracts and purchase insurance on behalf of those whom it is required or permitted to indemnify. The certificate of incorporation limits director liability for monetary damages to the fullest extent permissible under the DGCL.
    *   **Reasoning:** Indemnification protects directors and officers from personal liability for actions taken in their corporate capacity. It encourages them to take risks and make decisions without fear of personal financial ruin, within reasonable bounds.
    *   **Key Details:**
        *   Directors are *not* liable for monetary damages for breaches of the duty of care.
        *   **Exceptions:** Liability *remains* for breaches of the duty of loyalty, acts of bad faith or intentional misconduct, violations of DGCL Section 174, and transactions where the director received an improper personal benefit. Also, the federal securities and state/federal environmental laws are not affected by these limitations.
    *   **Implications:** The indemnification provisions make it easier to attract and retain qualified directors and officers. It signals that the company is willing to stand behind its leaders, but it also clarifies the circumstances under which directors *will* still be held accountable.

3.  **Transfer Agent and Stock Listing:**

    *   **Summary:** Computershare is NVIDIA's transfer agent and registrar. NVIDIA's common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "NVDA."
    *   **Reasoning:** This provides basic administrative and trading information.
    *   **Key Details:**
        *   Computershare's address is provided.

4.  **Global Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Award:**

    *   **Summary:** The text outlines the terms of a Global Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) award granted under NVIDIA's Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.
    *   **Reasoning:** RSUs are a common form of equity compensation used to incentivize employees and align their interests with those of the company's shareholders.
    *   **Key Details:**
        *   The RSU award is governed by a Grant Notice, a Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (including any country-specific appendix), and the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. In case of conflict, the Plan controls.
        *   The agreement supersedes all prior oral and written agreements (except certain employment agreements, insider trading policies, and compensation recovery policies).
        *   Acceptance of the award signifies consent to receive plan documents electronically.
        *   The agreement specifies the "Date of Grant", "Vesting Commencement Date", "Number of Restricted Stock Units/Shares Subject to Award", and the "Vesting Schedule". The schedule describes when the RSUs vest. Vesting is contingent upon continued service.
        *   The company will issue one share of common stock for each vested RSU according to the "Issuance Schedule."
        *   Vesting accelerates in the event of the participant's death.
        *   Vesting ceases upon termination of continuous service (except in case of death).
        *   The number of shares subject to vesting may be reduced if the Participant’s regular level of time commitment in the performance of services for the Company or any Affiliate is reduced after the Date of Grant.
        *    Vesting shall be suspended if the Participant goes on an approved personal leave of absence pursuant to the Company’s Personal Leave of Absence Policy 1. Effective Date: January 23, 2025 (the “PLOA Policy”) and the leave exceeds a certain duration.

**In Summary:**

This text provides a glimpse into several key aspects of NVIDIA's corporate structure, governance, and compensation practices. The anti-takeover provision and indemnification sections illustrate measures taken to protect the company and its leadership. The RSU award details demonstrate how the company incentivizes employees through equity ownership, aligning their interests with shareholder value. The overall tone is legalistic and carefully worded, reflecting the importance of these provisions for the company's operations and risk management.


This document outlines the terms and conditions related to restricted stock units (RSUs) granted to an employee or consultant. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**1. Issuance of Shares:**

*   **Issuance Deadline:** Shares resulting from accelerated vesting of RSUs must be issued by the Issuance Deadline, as defined in Section 6(b) of the agreement.
*   **Forfeiture Upon Termination:** If continuous service ends for any reason *other than death*, unvested RSUs are forfeited at no cost to the company.  Pro-rata vesting is explicitly disallowed if service terminates before a vesting date.
*   **Reduction Due to Reduced Time Commitment:** If the level of service commitment decreases *after* the grant date, the number of shares subject to vesting will be reduced accordingly. The reduction is rounded down to the nearest whole share.
*   **Leave of Absence Impact:**  Vesting is suspended during extended personal leaves of absence (PLOA) governed by the company's PLOA Policy, effective January 23, 2025. The vesting schedule is extended upon return as described in the PLOA Policy. No rights exist regarding the reduced portion of unvested awards.

**5. Date of Issuance (Section 409A Compliance):**

*   The issuance of shares intends to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4). The form of issuance (certificate or electronic) is determined by the Company.
*   Shares are issued on the vesting date (or as soon as administratively practical) for each vested RSU, referred to as the "Original Issuance Date." This is subject to withholding obligations and Section 6(c).
*   The "Issuance Deadline" is the latest of:
    *   December 31 of the year the vesting date occurs.
    *   The last day of the period allowed under Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A), if permitted.
    *   Any date that doesn't trigger adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
*   **Issuance Delay:** If withholding obligations exist *and* the Original Issuance Date is *not* during an "open window period" *or* a date when the recipient can sell shares on the open market (including under a 10b5-1 plan) *and* the company chooses *not* to withhold shares, allow a "same-day sale," or allow the recipient to pay withholding in cash, then issuance is delayed. In such cases, shares are issued on the first business day the recipient *can* sell shares or another date determined by the Company, but no later than the Issuance Deadline.

**6. Dividends:**

*   No benefits or adjustments are made to the award or unissued shares for cash or stock dividends or other distributions that *don't* result from a Capitalization Adjustment.
*   After vesting, no cash, stock, or property related to such dividends or distributions is issuable for vested RSUs.

**7. Restrictive Legends:**

*   Shares may be endorsed with restrictive legends if required by law or determined necessary by the company.

**8. Not a Service Contract:**

*   Continuous service is not for a specified term and can be terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause or notice (if permitted by law).

    *   Deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate employment at any time.

This document is a comprehensive outline of a Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Award granted by NVIDIA Corporation under its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan. It consists of a Grant Notice, a Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, and potentially an Appendix with country-specific terms.

**Key Components and Concepts:**

*   **Award Grant:** NVIDIA grants the participant an RSU Award, representing the right to receive shares of NVIDIA Common Stock in the future, contingent on the terms outlined in the Grant Notice, Agreement, and the Plan.
*   **Governing Documents:** The Grant Notice, the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (including any applicable Appendix), and the Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan collectively govern the Award. In case of conflict, the Plan takes precedence.
*   **Definitions:** Capitalized terms used throughout the documents are defined within each document or, if not, refer to the definitions in the Plan.
*   **Acceptance:** By accepting the Award, the participant agrees to all the terms and conditions of the Agreement and the Plan, consents to electronic delivery of Plan documents, and to participate in the Plan through electronic systems.
*   **Entire Understanding:** The Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the participant and the Company regarding the Award, superseding prior agreements except for:
    *   A current written employment agreement that expressly specifies terms governing the Award.
    *   The Company’s insider trading policy.
    *   Any compensation recovery policy adopted by the Company or required by law.
*   **Vesting:**
    *   The Award vests according to the vesting schedule specified in the Grant Notice, contingent upon the participant's Continuous Service.
    *   Vesting ceases upon termination of Continuous Service, except in the case of death.
    *   Death accelerates vesting as described in the Grant Notice. If death occurs before Committee Certification, the award becomes fully vested at the Target Award, if the company receives written notification before the certification.
    *   Unvested Restricted Stock Units are forfeited upon termination of Continuous Service (excluding termination due to death, which triggers accelerated vesting as specified).
    *   Partial vesting is not granted for service completed before a vesting date if the service terminates before that date.
*   **Issuance of Shares:** The Company will issue one share of Common Stock for each vested RSU at the time specified in Section 6 of the Agreement.
*   **Bookkeeping Account:** The Company maintains a bookkeeping account for the participant to track the Restricted Stock Units. No payment is required from the participant for receiving the Award, vesting, or delivery of the underlying stock.
*   **Transferability:** The Company's rights and obligations are transferable to successors and assigns. The participant's rights are not assignable without the Company's prior written consent.
*   **Further Assurances:** The participant agrees to execute any necessary documents to carry out the Award's purpose.
*   **Review and Understanding:** The participant acknowledges reviewing the Award, having the opportunity to seek legal counsel, and fully understanding its provisions.
*   **Successors:** The Company's obligations are binding on any successor entity.
*   **Amendment:**
    *   The Agreement can only be modified, amended, or terminated by a written instrument signed by both the participant and an authorized representative of the Company, subject to Section 21.
    *   The Board can unilaterally amend the agreement in writing, provided a copy is delivered to the participant and the amendment does not adversely affect the participant's rights without their written consent.
    *   The Board can amend the Agreement to comply with changes in applicable laws, regulations, rulings, or judicial decisions, but such changes only apply to the restricted portion of the Award.
*   **Section 409A Compliance:**
    *   The Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) to avoid being treated as deferred compensation. It will be construed and administered accordingly.
    *   Each vesting installment is intended to constitute a "separate payment" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2).
    *   If the Award is determined to be deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A, it will be administered to comply with Section 409A to avoid adverse tax consequences.
    *   If the participant is a "specified employee" upon "separation from service," the issuance of shares will be delayed for six months (or until death, if earlier) to comply with Code Section 409A.
*   **Grant Details:** The Grant Notice specifies details such as the Date of Grant, Vesting Commencement Date, Threshold, Target, and Maximum Award amounts, the Actual Award amount, and the Vesting Schedule. The grant date is January 23, 2025.
*   **Issuance Schedule:** The agreement details the schedule by which shares will be issued upon vesting of the RSUs.
*   **Miscellaneous:** The agreement covers miscellaneous aspects such as choice of law, and the agreement to provide further documents as necessary.

In summary, this RSU award provides the participant with the opportunity to earn NVIDIA stock based on a vesting schedule tied to continuous service. The document explicitly details the terms, conditions, and legal considerations associated with the grant, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and providing clarity to both the company and the participant.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to break down the key points and preserve context.

**Overall Purpose:**

This document outlines the terms and conditions of a Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) award granted by a Company to an employee or consultant. It covers vesting, forfeiture, issuance of shares, legal compliance, transfer restrictions, and tax responsibilities. The document emphasizes that the award is *not* a service contract and does not guarantee continued employment or service.

**Section-by-Section Breakdown:**

*   **Section 2(b) (Acceleration upon Death):**
    *   If the participant dies, their executor or administrator (or beneficiary) might need to provide information (like tax info) to the Company, as legally permissible.
    *   Any acceleration of RSU vesting due to death will result in shares being issued no later than the "Issuance Deadline" (defined later in Section 6(b)).
*   **Section 2(c) (Termination of Service):**
    *   If the participant's "Continuous Service" terminates for a reason *other* than death, unvested RSUs are forfeited back to the Company at no cost. The participant loses all rights to those RSUs and underlying shares.
    *   Upon death, unvested RSUs (not accelerated) are also forfeited.
    *   Importantly, partial service during a vesting period doesn't entitle the participant to a pro-rata portion of RSUs if their service terminates before the vesting date.
*   **Section 3 (Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock):**
    *   The number of RSUs and related shares is subject to adjustment for "Capitalization Adjustments" (as defined in the Plan).  This likely refers to events like stock splits, dividends, or mergers.
    *   Any new RSUs, shares, cash or property resulting from a Capitalization Adjustment will be subject to the same restrictions as the original award.
    *   No fractional shares will be issued. The Board will round down to the nearest whole share or unit.
*   **Section 4 (Compliance with Law):**
    *   Shares will only be issued if (a) they are registered under the Securities Act, OR (b) the Company determines an exemption from registration exists.
    *   The Award must also comply with all other applicable laws (US and non-US, state, federal, local). Shares won't be issued if it violates these laws.
*   **Section 5 (Limitations on Transfer):**
    *   The RSU award is *not* transferable except by will or inheritance (laws of descent and distribution).
    *   Before shares are issued, the participant cannot assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber, or dispose of any interest in the shares.
    *   *After* shares are issued, the participant is free to transfer them, but still subject to this Agreement and securities laws.
    *   If permitted by the Board and applicable law, a beneficiary can be designated to receive the shares upon the participant's death.
*   **Section 6 (Date of Issuance):**
    *   The issuance of shares is intended to comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4).  This is related to deferred compensation rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will administer the plan accordingly.
    *   The form of issuance (stock certificate, electronic entry) is determined by the Company.
    *   Subject to tax withholding obligations and section 6(c), when RSUs vest, the Company will issue one share of Common Stock for each vested RSU on the vesting date (or as soon as practical thereafter). This date is called the “Original Issuance Date”.
    *   The "Original Issuance Date" will occur no later than the "Issuance Deadline," which is the latest of the following: December 31 of the year the vesting date occurs; the last day of the period set forth in Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4)(i)(A) (if permitted); or any date permitted without adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code.
    *   If there are tax withholding obligations and the Original Issuance Date falls outside an "open window period" or a time when the participant can otherwise sell shares (e.g., under a 10b5-1 plan), *and* the Company decides not to withhold shares, permit a same-day sale, or allow the participant to cover taxes in cash, then the share issuance is delayed. The shares will be issued on the first business day the participant *can* sell shares, or another date determined by the Company, but no later than the Issuance Deadline.
*   **Section 7 (Dividends):**
    *   The participant will not receive any benefit or adjustment to the award for cash dividends, stock dividends, or other distributions that do not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. After the vesting date, no cash, stock, or other property related to such dividend or distribution will be issuable in respect of your vested Restricted Stock Units.
*   **Section 8 (Restrictive Legends):**
    *   Shares issued may have restrictive legends placed on them if required by law or otherwise deemed necessary by the Company.
*   **Section 9 (Award Not a Service Contract):**
    *   Crucially, this section emphasizes that the award does *not* guarantee continued employment or service.
    *   Employment/service is at-will and can be terminated by either party at any time, with or without cause or notice (if permitted by law).
    *   The award does not promise future positions, work assignments, compensation, or any other condition of employment.
    *   The Company can reorganize, sell, spin off, or restructure its businesses, which could lead to termination of service and loss of benefits. The Agreement does not guarantee the employee will remain engaged as an Employee or Consultant for any period.
*   **Section 10 (Responsibility for Taxes):**
    *   The participant is ultimately responsible for all taxes related to the award, even if the Company withholds some taxes.
    *   The Company makes no guarantees about the tax treatment of the award.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   This RSU agreement is designed to grant equity compensation, but it is *carefully structured to avoid creating an employment contract*.
*   Vesting is contingent on continued service.
*   The company retains significant flexibility in managing the timing of share issuance, particularly to comply with tax laws and regulations related to insider trading and deferred compensation.
*   Participants are responsible for understanding and paying taxes on their awards.
*   The agreement is subject to adjustments and interpretations based on the Company's Plan documents and applicable laws.

This document section primarily concerns tax responsibilities related to the Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) award and clarifies the nature of the grant, emphasizing its discretionary and non-obligatory nature. Here's a breakdown:

**Section 10: Responsibility for Taxes**

*   **Ultimate Tax Liability:** The employee acknowledges that they are ultimately responsible for all tax-related items (income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, etc.) associated with their participation in the plan, regardless of any actions taken by the Company or the Service Recipient. This liability may exceed the amount withheld by the Company.
*   **No Representations or Obligations:** The Company and the Service Recipient make no guarantees about the tax treatment of the RSUs or underlying shares and are not obligated to structure the grant to minimize the employee's tax liability.
*   **No Claims Against the Company:** The employee agrees not to make any claims against the Company or its affiliates for tax-related issues arising from the award, even if subject to taxes in multiple jurisdictions.
*   **Tax Withholding Arrangements:** The employee agrees to make adequate arrangements to satisfy all tax-related obligations. The Company is authorized to withhold taxes through various methods, including:

    *   Withholding from wages or other cash compensation.
    *   Requiring a cash payment from the employee.
    *   Facilitating a "same day sale" of shares through a broker to cover taxes.
    *   Withholding shares of Common Stock equal to the tax obligation (especially for officers, unless infeasible or with adverse accounting consequences).
    *   Any other legally compliant method determined by the Company.
*   **Withholding Rates:** The Company may use statutory or maximum withholding rates, and over-withholding may result in a refund. Under-withholding requires the employee to pay the difference.
*   **Full Share Issuance for Tax Purposes:** Even if shares are withheld to cover taxes, the employee is considered to have been issued the full number of shares for tax purposes.
*   **No Share Delivery Without Satisfied Tax Obligations:** The Company is not obligated to deliver shares if tax obligations are not met.
*   **Indemnification:** The employee agrees to indemnify the Company and Service Recipient against any failure to withhold the proper amount of taxes.

**Section 11: Nature of Grant**

*   **Voluntary and Discretionary Plan:** The employee acknowledges that the stock plan is voluntary, discretionary, and can be modified or terminated by the Company.
*   **Company as Sole Party:** The agreement is solely between the employee and the Company. Affiliates (including the Service Recipient) have no obligations.
*   **No Obligation for Future Awards:** The award is exceptional and doesn't create any right to future awards or benefits in lieu of awards. Future awards are at the Company's discretion.
*   **Incentive for Future Services:** The award is an incentive for future services and not compensation for past services.
*   **Voluntary Participation:** The employee is voluntarily participating in the plan.
*   **Extraordinary Item, Not Compensation:** The award is an extraordinary item and, if the Service Recipient is not the Company, not compensation for services rendered to the Service Recipient.
*   **Not Replacing Pension Rights:** The award is not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation.
*   **Not Part of Normal Compensation:** The award is not part of normal compensation for purposes of calculating severance, bonuses, or other benefits, unless explicitly provided in the relevant plan.
*   **Unknown Future Value:** The future value of the shares is uncertain.
*   **No Claim for Forfeiture:** No claim arises from the forfeiture of the award due to termination of service, except in the case of death.
*   **No Entitlement to Transfer:** The award doesn't create any entitlement to have the award transferred to or assumed by another company in a corporate transaction.
*   **Not Consideration for Director Service:** The award is not granted as consideration for service as a director of an affiliate, unless otherwise agreed.
*   **Specific Clauses for International Employees:** For employees outside the US, the award is not part of normal compensation, and the Company is not liable for foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

**Section 12: No Advice Regarding Grant**

*   The Company isn't providing tax, legal, or financial advice. The employee is advised to seek their own professional counsel. Acceptance of the award implies the employee has done so or knowingly declined.

**Section 13: Unsecured Obligation**

*   The award is unfunded, and the employee is considered an unsecured creditor. This indicates that if the company faces financial difficulties, the award isn't guaranteed.

In essence, these sections ensure the employee understands their tax obligations related to the RSUs, that the Company is not providing any guarantees or advice, and that the award is a discretionary benefit, not an entitlement. The document also clarifies the limited scope of the agreement and the voluntary nature of the plan.

*   **Foreign Assets/Account and Tax Reporting, Exchange Controls:** The recipient might have foreign asset, account, and tax reporting obligations in their country, affecting their ability to hold shares or cash received. Repatriation of funds may be required. Tax obligations may also apply. Compliance is the recipient's responsibility.

**Sections 21-26: General Provisions and Compliance**

*   **Imposition of Other Requirements:** The company can impose further requirements on participation, the award, or shares acquired, for legal or administrative reasons.

    *   The company's obligations are binding on any successor.

The Board can change the agreement to comply with changes in laws or regulations.
*   **Compliance with Section 409A of the Code:** This section states that the award is intended to be compliant with Section 409A of the U.S. Tax Code, and therefore, not considered deferred compensation. The agreement should be construed and managed accordingly.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to break down the key elements and relationships.

**Part 1: Acknowledgment and Agreement Amendment**

*   **Understanding and Acceptance:** The text first emphasizes that the recipient of the award has thoroughly reviewed it, sought legal counsel, and fully understands its provisions before accepting it. This underlines the importance of informed consent.

*   **Successor Binding:** The agreement explicitly states that the company's obligations under the plan will transfer to any successor entity that results from a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction involving substantially all of the company's business or assets. This protects the employee's rights in the event of a change in corporate ownership.

*   **Amendment Process:**
    *   **Written Instrument:** Generally, the agreement can only be modified, amended, or terminated by a written document signed by both the employee and an authorized company representative.
    *   **Board Amendment:** The Board of Directors has the power to unilaterally amend the agreement, but only if the amendment is in writing, specifically states that it is amending the agreement, and a copy is delivered to the employee. Crucially, any amendment that *adversely* affects the employee's rights requires the employee's written consent.
    *   **Legal/Regulatory Changes:** The Board can change the agreement to comply with changes in laws or regulations. However, this type of change only applies to the portion of the award that is still subject to restrictions.

**Part 2: Section 409A Compliance**

*   **Intent to Avoid Deferred Compensation Rules:** The award is designed to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4). The goal is to avoid being classified as "deferred compensation," which would trigger specific and potentially unfavorable tax rules under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). Any ambiguity is to be interpreted to fulfill this intention.

*   **Separate Payments:** Each installment of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) vesting is intended to be a "separate payment" for purposes of Treasury Regulations, further supporting the intent to avoid 409A implications.

*   **Contingency for 409A Applicability:** If the award *is* determined to be subject to Section 409A, the award must be administered in a way that avoids adverse tax consequences for the employee.

*   **Specified Employee Delay:** If the employee is a "specified employee" under Section 409A *and* experiences a "separation from service" (termination of employment), the issuance of shares, cash, or property that would normally occur at or soon after termination will be delayed. It will instead be issued in a lump sum six months and one day after termination (or, if earlier, upon the employee's death), *but only if* this delay is necessary to avoid 409A penalties.

**Part 3: Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) Overview**

*   **Plan Name:** NVIDIA Corporation Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The document lists the various dates the plan was amended and restated.
*   **Successor Plan:** The ESPP is intended as the successor to the NVIDIA Corporation 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “1998 Plan”). No additional purchase rights will be granted under the 1998 plan after the effective date.
*   **1998 Plan's Available Reserve:** Shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be available under the 1998 Plan will be added to the new Share Reserve.
*   **Returning Shares:** Shares subject to outstanding grants under the 1998 Plan will not return to the 1998 plan's share reserve. Instead, they will be added to the new Share Reserve.
*   **Purpose:** The plan allows eligible employees to purchase company stock, incentivizing them to contribute to the company's success and helping with employee retention and attraction.
*   **Two Components:**
    *   **423 Component:** Intended to qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Code. It is construed to be consistent with the requirements of Section 423.
    *   **Non-423 Component:** Allows for deviations from Section 423 requirements to accommodate foreign employees and comply with foreign laws. This component is generally administered in the same manner as the 423 Component, unless otherwise specified.
*   **Transfer of Employment:**
    *   Transferring from 423 to Non-423: Participation in the 423 Component ceases, contributions are transferred to the Non-423 Component, and the employee joins the Non-423 Component's current offering.
    *   Transferring from Non-423 to 423: The employee remains in the Non-423 Component until the earlier of the end of the current offering period or the offering date of the first offering in which he or she participates following such transfer.

**Part 4: Plan Administration**

*   **Board or Committee:** The Board of Directors administers the plan, but it can delegate this responsibility to a committee.
*   **Board Powers:** The Board has broad powers, including:
    *   Determining when and how purchase rights are granted.
    *   Designating which related corporations can participate.
    *   Interpreting the plan and creating rules for its administration.
    *   Resolving controversies.
    *   Suspending or terminating the plan.
    *   Amending the plan.
    *   Generally acting in the best interests of the company.
    *   Adopting procedures for foreign employees. The Board is authorized to adopt rules, procedures and subplans, which, for purposes of the Non-423 Component, may be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code, regarding, without limitation, eligibility to participate in the Plan, handling and making of Contributions, establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of share issuances, which may vary according to local requirements.
*   **Delegation to Committee:** The Board can delegate administrative duties to a committee.


This document outlines the structure and function of an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Here's a detailed summary:

**1. Administration:**

*   **Board Authority:** The Board of Directors (or a designated committee) has broad authority to administer the ESPP, including:
    *   Establishing, amending, and revoking rules/regulations.
    *   Correcting defects, omissions, or inconsistencies in the plan to ensure it's fully effective.
    *   Settling disputes related to the Plan and purchase rights.
    *   Suspending or terminating the plan (as per Section 12).
    *   Amending the plan (as per Section 12).
    *   Exercising powers and performing acts deemed necessary to promote the Company's and related entities' best interests, ensuring the "423 Component" is treated as a qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
    *   Adopting procedures and sub-plans to facilitate participation for foreign national employees or those located outside the U.S., potentially outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code (Non-423 Component), regarding eligibility, contributions, bank accounts, interest, currency conversion, payroll tax, beneficiary designations, withholding, and share issuances, varying according to local laws.
*   **Delegation:** The Board can delegate administrative duties to a committee, which then possesses the Board's delegated powers, including delegating to subcommittees. The Board can also retain concurrent administrative authority or reclaim delegated powers.
*   **Final Authority:** Regardless of delegation, the Board retains final say on policy and expediency matters.
*   **Good Faith Determinations:** The Board's interpretations and decisions made in good faith are final and binding.

**2. Shares Subject to the Plan:**

*   **Share Reserve:** A maximum of 3,737,293,320 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance under the plan.
    *   This number accounts for several stock splits and shares approved at various annual stockholder meetings.
    *   Also includes shares from a previous plan (1998 Plan's Available Reserve) and "Returning Shares" (shares that become available when purchase rights terminate unexercised).
*   **Reissuance:** Shares not purchased under a terminated Purchase Right become available for issuance again.
*   **Source of Shares:** Shares can be authorized but unissued, or reacquired (including shares repurchased on the open market).

**3. Grant of Purchase Rights and Offerings:**

*   **Offerings:** The Board may grant Purchase Rights to eligible employees through "Offerings" on specified "Offering Dates."
*   **Terms:** Offerings will have terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the Board, and the 423 Component must comply with Section 423(b)(5) of the Code (equal rights and privileges for all grantees).
*   **Offering Period:** Each Offering will have a period of effectiveness not exceeding 27 months from the Offering Date and will incorporate provisions from Sections 5 through 8.
*   **Multiple Purchase Rights:** If a participant has multiple purchase rights, forms apply to all rights, and lower-priced (or earlier granted, if prices are identical) rights are exercised first.
*   **Offering Restructuring:** The Board can structure offerings to terminate automatically and enroll participants in a new offering if the fair market value of the stock on the first trading day of a new purchase period is equal to or less than the participant's offering date price.

**4. Eligibility:**

*   **Eligible Employees:** Purchase Rights can be granted to employees of the Company, its Related Corporations, or Affiliates as designated by the Board.
*   **Continuous Employment:** Employees generally must have a continuous period of employment, as determined by the Board, but not exceeding two years prior to the Offering Date.
*   **Work Hour Requirements:** The Board can require customary employment of more than 20 hours per week and more than five months per calendar year (or other criteria consistent with Section 423 of the Code).
*   **Mid-Offering Eligibility:** The Board may allow individuals who become eligible employees during an Offering to be granted a purchase right, with the grant date treated as the Offering Date for that right.
*   **Ownership Limit:** Employees owning 5% or more of the Company's or a Related Corporation's stock (voting power or value) are ineligible (unless otherwise required by law). Section 424(d) of the Code applies to stock ownership calculations.
*   **$25,000 Limit:** Purchase Rights cannot allow an employee's right to purchase stock to accrue at a rate exceeding $25,000 of fair market value per calendar year (determined at the Offering Date), consistent with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code.
*   **Officer Eligibility:** Company officers can participate if otherwise eligible. However, the Board can exclude highly compensated employees (within the meaning of Section 423(b)(4)(D) of the Code).

**5. Purchase Rights and Purchase Price:**

*   **Grant on Offering Date:** On each Offering Date, eligible employees are granted Purchase Rights to purchase shares, up to a percentage or maximum dollar amount (not exceeding 25%) of their eligible earnings during the offering period.
*   **Purchase Dates:** The Board establishes one or more Purchase Dates during an Offering to exercise Purchase Rights.
*   **Purchase Limits:** The Board can specify maximums for:
    *   Shares purchasable by a participant on any Purchase Date.
    *   Aggregate shares purchasable by all participants in the Offering.
    *   Aggregate shares purchasable by all participants on any Purchase Date.

This detailed summary aims to capture all the key elements of the provided text, providing a comprehensive overview of the ESPP's structure, administration, and eligibility requirements.


This document outlines the terms and conditions of a company's employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), detailing eligibility, purchase rights, contribution methods, withdrawal procedures, and other key aspects. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Purchase Rights and Limitations:**

*   **Granting of Rights:** Eligible employees receive purchase rights to acquire common stock. The number of shares purchasable is determined by the Board, either as a percentage (up to 25%) or a maximum dollar amount of the employee's eligible earnings during a defined offering period. The Board defines "eligible earnings."
*   **Board Discretion:** The Board has considerable discretion in setting the percentage/dollar amount application frequency (per pay period, purchase period, etc.)
*   **Purchase Dates:** The Board sets one or more purchase dates within each offering.
*   **Purchase Limits:** The Board can specify maximum limits on (i) the number of shares an individual participant can buy on a purchase date, (ii) the total number of shares purchasable under an offering, and (iii) the total number of shares purchasable by all participants on any given purchase date.
*   **Pro Rata Allocation:** If demand exceeds the maximum share limits, shares are allocated pro rata based on accumulated contributions, aiming for a uniform and equitable distribution.
*   **Purchase Price:** The purchase price per share is at least 85% of the *lesser* of (i) the share's fair market value on the offering date or (ii) the share's fair market value on the applicable purchase date.

**2. Participation, Withdrawal, and Termination:**

*   **Enrollment:** Eligible employees enroll by authorizing payroll deductions through a company-provided form, specifying the contribution amount (within Board-set limits).
*   **Contribution Handling:** Contributions are credited to an individual bookkeeping account and typically deposited into the company's general funds unless legally required otherwise.
*   **Contribution Adjustments:** Participants may be allowed to reduce or increase contributions (even to zero), subject to offering terms.
*   **Alternative Contributions:** Offerings or applicable law might allow contributions via cash, check, or wire transfer in addition to, or instead of, payroll deductions.
*   **Withdrawal:** Participants can withdraw from an offering by submitting a withdrawal form. A deadline before a Purchase Date for withdrawing may be imposed. Withdrawal immediately terminates the purchase right for that offering, and accumulated contributions are returned to the participant. Withdrawal doesn't affect eligibility for future offerings, but a new enrollment form is required.
*   **Termination of Purchase Rights:** Purchase rights terminate immediately if the participant ceases to be an employee or becomes ineligible, and unused contributions are returned.
*   **Exercise Restrictions:** Purchase rights are non-transferable and exercisable only by the participant during their lifetime, except by will, inheritance, or beneficiary designation (if permitted by the Company).
*   **No Interest:** The company isn't obligated to pay interest on contributions unless legally required.

**3. Exercise of Purchase Rights:**

*   **Application of Contributions:** On each purchase date, accumulated contributions are used to purchase shares at the offering's specified price, up to the plan and offering limits. Fractional shares are not issued unless specifically provided.
*   **Remaining Contributions:** If, after the final purchase date of an offering, remaining contributions are insufficient to buy a full share, they are rolled over to the next offering, unless the participant withdraws or is ineligible. In that case, the amount is distributed. If the remaining amount *is* sufficient to buy a full share, it is distributed in full and *not* rolled over.
*   **Registration and Compliance:** Purchase rights can't be exercised unless the shares are covered by an effective SEC registration statement and the plan complies with applicable laws. If these conditions aren't met on a purchase date, the purchase date is delayed, but no more than 27 months from the offering date. If registration/compliance still aren't met after this maximum delay, purchase rights are cancelled, and contributions are returned.

**4. Company Covenants:**

*   **Regulatory Approval:** The company will try to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for granting purchase rights and issuing stock, unless the cost is unreasonable compared to the benefit to employees.
*   **Liability Relief:** If the company can't obtain necessary legal authority at a commercially reasonable cost, it's relieved of liability for failing to grant purchase rights or issue stock.

**5. Beneficiary Designation:**

*   **Optional Designation:** The company *may* allow participants to designate a beneficiary to receive shares/contributions in case of death.
*   **Company Discretion:** The company isn't obligated to permit beneficiary designations or changes.
*   **Absence of Designation:** If no beneficiary is designated, shares/contributions go to the participant's estate. If no executor/administrator exists, the company *may* distribute to the spouse, dependents, relatives, or another person it designates.

**6. Adjustments and Corporate Transactions:**

*   **Capitalization Adjustments:** In the event of a stock split, dividend, or other capitalization adjustment, the Board will proportionately adjust (i) the number of shares under the plan, (ii) the number of shares and purchase price of outstanding offerings, and (iii) purchase limits in ongoing offerings.
*   **Corporate Transactions:** In a merger or acquisition: (i) the surviving/acquiring company *may* assume or substitute purchase rights, or (ii) if they don't, participants' contributions will be used to purchase shares shortly before the transaction, and purchase rights will terminate.

**7. Amendment, Termination, and Suspension:**

*   **Amendment:** The Board can amend the plan as needed. However, stockholder approval is required for amendments that (i) increase the number of shares, (ii) expand eligibility, (iii) materially increase benefits or reduce the purchase price, (iv) extend the plan's term, or (v) expand award types, *but only to the extent stockholder approval is required by applicable law or listing requirements.*
*   **Suspension/Termination:** The Board can suspend or terminate the plan at any time, preventing further grant of purchase rights.
*   **Protection of Existing Rights:** Amendments, suspensions, or terminations generally can't materially impair existing purchase rights, except with the participant's consent or to comply with laws/regulations.


Okay, here's a detailed, robust, and token-expansive summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to preserve context and key details:

**Overall Purpose of the Document:**

This document outlines the terms and conditions of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) offered by NVIDIA Corporation. The Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of NVIDIA's Common Stock at a potentially discounted price through payroll deductions. The document details various aspects of the plan, including eligibility, amendment/termination procedures, tax implications, and definitions of key terms.

**Key Sections and Their Details:**

1.  **Corporate Transactions and Purchase Rights (Section 11 - Partial):**

    *   If NVIDIA undergoes a "Corporate Transaction" (defined later), the plan addresses how outstanding "Purchase Rights" (the right to buy stock under the plan) are handled.
    *   If the acquiring entity *doesn't* assume the existing Purchase Rights or offer similar rights in substitution, then the accumulated contributions of the participants will be used to purchase shares of Common Stock *before* the Corporate Transaction closes. This purchase will occur within ten business days leading up to the transaction. The Purchase Rights will then terminate.

2.  **Amendment, Termination, or Suspension of the Plan (Section 12):**

    *   **Amendment:** The Board of Directors has broad authority to amend the plan at any time. However, certain amendments require stockholder approval:
        *   **Material Increase in Shares:** Any change that significantly increases the number of shares available for issuance under the plan.
        *   **Material Expansion of Eligibility:** Broadening the class of individuals who can participate.
        *   **Material Increase in Benefits/Reduction in Price:** Enhancing participant benefits or lowering the stock purchase price.
        *   **Material Extension of Term:** Lengthening the duration of the plan.
        *   **Expansion of Award Types:** Adding new types of awards beyond stock purchase rights.
        *   These triggers for stockholder approval are invoked only to the extent required by applicable law or listing requirements.
    *   **Suspension/Termination:** The Board can suspend or terminate the plan at any time, preventing the granting of new Purchase Rights.
    *   **Impact on Existing Rights:** Amendments, suspensions, or terminations *cannot* materially impair existing Purchase Rights, *except* in specific situations:
        *   With the consent of the participant.
        *   To comply with laws, listing requirements, or governmental regulations, including Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (which governs ESPPs) and related guidance.
        *   To obtain or maintain favorable tax, listing, or regulatory treatment. This specifically allows the Board to amend outstanding Purchase Rights without a Participant's consent if necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code.

3.  **Code Section 409A; Tax Qualification (Section 13):**

    *   **423 Component vs. Non-423 Component:** The plan may have two components. The "423 Component" is designed to comply with Section 423 of the Code to qualify as an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The "Non-423 Component" may apply to employees who are *not* eligible for the 423 Component, potentially including non-U.S. employees.
    *   **Section 409A Compliance:** The plan intends for Purchase Rights under the 423 Component to be *exempt* from Section 409A of the Code (which governs deferred compensation). Purchase Rights under the Non-423 Component granted to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be exempt under the *short-term deferral exception.* The plan will be interpreted to ensure compliance with this intent.
    *   If a Purchase Right is subject to Section 409A, it will be administered to comply with the regulations.
    *   **No Guarantee of Tax Treatment:** The company explicitly states that it *does not guarantee* favorable tax treatment under U.S. or foreign laws, even if it attempts to achieve it. The company's corporate activities will *not* be constrained by potential negative tax impacts on participants.

4.  **Effective Date (Section 14):**

    *   The plan becomes effective on the "Effective Date" (defined later).
    *   No Purchase Rights can be exercised until the plan has been approved by the company's stockholders. This approval must be within 12 months before or after the Board adopts the plan.

5.  **Miscellaneous Provisions (Section 15):**

    *   Proceeds from stock sales under the plan become general funds of the company.
    *   Participants are not considered stockholders until their shares are recorded in the company's books.
    *   The plan is *not* an employment contract and does not alter at-will employment status. It doesn't obligate either the employee to stay or the company to continue employment.
    *   The plan is governed by California law (without regard to its conflict of laws rules).
    *   If any provision is found invalid, it does not invalidate the rest of the plan.

6.  **Definitions (Section 16):** This section defines key terms used throughout the document. Here are a few highlights:

    *   **423 Component:** The part of the Plan that allows for grants of Purchase Rights to Eligible Employees, satisfying the requirements for Employee Stock Purchase Plans.
    *   **Affiliate:** A branch or representative office of a Related Corporation, as determined by the Board.
    *   **Board:** The Board of Directors of NVIDIA.
    *   **Capitalization Adjustment:** Changes to the Common Stock, e.g., stock splits, stock dividends, mergers, etc. The conversion of convertible securities is *not* considered a Capitalization Adjustment.
    *   **Code:** The U.S. Internal Revenue Code.
    *   **Common Stock:** NVIDIA's common stock.
    *   **Company:** NVIDIA Corporation.
    *   **Contributions:** Payroll deductions and other payments made by participants to fund the exercise of a Purchase Right.
    *   **Corporate Transaction:** A sale of substantially all assets, sale of at least 50% of outstanding securities, merger where NVIDIA isn't the surviving corporation, or merger where NVIDIA survives but the common stock is converted into other property. This definition has a caveat to ensure compliance with Section 409A of the Code.
    *   **Designated Non-423 Corporation:** Any Related Corporation or Affiliate selected by the Board as eligible to participate in the Non-423 Component.
    *   **Designated Company:** A Designated Non-423 Corporation or Designated 423 Corporation.
    *   **Designated 423 Corporation:** Any Related Corporation selected by the Board as eligible to participate in the 423 Component.
    *   **Director:** A member of the Board.
    *   **Effective Date:** The effective date of the plan document, which is the date of the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company provided this Plan is approved by the Company's stockholders at such meeting.
    *   **Eligible Employee:** An Employee who meets the requirements set forth in the document(s) governing the Offering for eligibility to participate in the Offering, provided that such Employee also meets the requirements for eligibility to participate set forth in the Plan.
    *   **Employee:** Any person treated as an employee in the company's records, including officers and directors, but directors are not considered "employees" solely for their director services.
    *   **Employee Stock Purchase Plan:** A plan that grants Purchase Rights intended to be options issued under an “employee stock purchase plan,” as that term is defined in Section 423(b) of the Code.
    *   **Exchange Act:** The U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
    *   **Fair Market Value:** Determined based on stock exchange/market prices or another reliable source.

**In Summary:**

This document establishes the framework for NVIDIA's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, outlining the rules for participation, stock purchases, plan administration, potential amendments/termination, and tax considerations. The Plan is subject to Board oversight, and certain changes require stockholder approval. The document is carefully drafted to comply with relevant regulations, including Section 423 and Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, while also providing the company with flexibility in administering the plan. It also explicitly avoids creating any contractual employment obligations.


Okay, here's a detailed summary of the provided text, breaking it down section by section with chain-of-thought reasoning to maintain context and capture key details:

**Section 1: Definitions Related to the NVIDIA Corporation Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan**

This section defines terms critical to understanding the NVIDIA Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Here's a breakdown of the definitions:

*   **(p) Eligible Employee:** An employee who meets the eligibility requirements outlined in both the specific "Offering Document" and the overall ESPP document. This emphasizes a two-tiered eligibility check.
*   **(q) Employee:** Broadly defines an employee as anyone treated as such by NVIDIA or a "Related Corporation" (including officers and directors).  Crucially, it clarifies that simply being a Director and receiving fees doesn't automatically qualify someone as an "Employee" for ESPP purposes.
*   **(r) Employee Stock Purchase Plan:** Defines what an ESPP is, explicitly referencing Section 423(b) of the Code (U.S. Internal Revenue Code), indicating that the plan intends to qualify under these favorable tax provisions.
*   **(s) Exchange Act:** Simply defines this common abbreviation as the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
*   **(t) Fair Market Value:** This is a crucial definition for determining the price at which employees can purchase stock. It prioritizes using the closing sales price on established stock exchanges or markets. If no closing price exists on the determination date, the price from the immediately preceding date is used. If no such market exists, the Board of Directors determines the Fair Market Value in good faith and compliance with applicable laws. This gives the Board flexibility in determining value.
*   **(u) Non-423 Component:** Defines the portion of the plan that *doesn't* qualify as a standard Employee Stock Purchase Plan under Section 423 of the Code. This suggests the plan has two parts: one with favorable tax treatment and one without.
*   **(v) Offering:** Explains that an "Offering" is the grant of Purchase Rights to eligible employees, which are then automatically exercised at the end of one or more Purchase Periods. The specific terms of each Offering are detailed in an "Offering Document" approved by the Board.
*   **(w) Offering Date:** The date chosen by the Board of Directors for an Offering to commence.
*   **(x) Offering Date Price:** This is the fair market value of the common stock on the offering date, which applies to the participant.
*   **(y) Officer:** Defines an "Officer" with reference to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, indicating that these individuals are subject to specific reporting requirements and potential liability.
*   **(z) Participant:** Defines a participant as an eligible employee who holds an outstanding purchase right.
*   **(aa) Plan:** Defines the "Plan" as the NVIDIA Corporation Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, including both the 423 and Non-423 Components, as amended from time to time.
*   **(bb) Purchase Date:** One or more dates selected by the Board on which purchase rights will be exercised.
*   **(cc) Purchase Period:** A time period specified within an Offering, beginning on the Offering Date or the first Trading Day following a Purchase Date, and ending on a Purchase Date. An Offering may consist of one or more Purchase Periods.
*   **(dd) Purchase Right:** An option to purchase shares of Common Stock granted pursuant to the Plan.
*   **(ee) Related Corporation:**  Defines this in relation to Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of the Code ("parent corporation" or "subsidiary corporation").
*   **(ff) Securities Act:** The U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
*   **(gg) Trading Day:** Defines a trading day as any day when the exchanges or markets on which the company shares are listed are open for trading.

**Section 2: Insider Trading Policy**

This section outlines NVIDIA's policy regarding insider trading, emphasizing prohibitions and restrictions to prevent illegal and unethical activities.

*   **Applicability:** The policy applies broadly to NVIDIA employees, board members, contractors, and consultants, extending even to those who use third parties to trade on their behalf. This underlines the individual's responsibility for compliance. Trading activities of household members and those subject to the individual's influence are also scrutinized.
*   **MNPI Definition:** Defines "MNPI" as material, non-public information. Information is "material" if it would influence a reasonable investor's decision to trade or significantly alter public information. Information is "non-public" if it hasn't been broadly disseminated via press release, conference call, public filing, etc. It is clarified that only a small subset of non-public information rises to the level of MNPI.
*   **Examples of Material Information:** Provides examples such as financial results, mergers/acquisitions, major contracts, product information, information about competition/customers/market demand, cybersecurity breaches, data protection/privacy incidents, key personnel changes, litigation, or regulatory activity.
*   **Blanket Prohibitions:**  Enforces several absolute prohibitions, *regardless* of whether the individual possesses MNPI or if a trading window is open. These include:
    *   Trading in NVIDIA derivatives (call and put options).
    *   Hedging or shorting NVIDIA securities.
    *   Purchasing or holding NVIDIA securities on margin.
    *   Pledging NVIDIA securities as collateral.
    *   Providing information to the press or financial community without authorization.
*   **Additional Restrictions for "Designated Individuals":** Imposes further restrictions on "Designated Individuals" (those with access to potentially material financial information, as identified in Workday).  These individuals are barred from trading or gifting NVIDIA securities during quarterly closed trading windows (starting five weeks before the end of the fiscal quarter and generally reopening on the 2nd trading day after earnings are announced), except under a 10b5-1 trading plan.
*   **Special Restrictions:** NVIDIA can impose "special trading restrictions" on anyone who becomes aware of non-public information that creates an insider trading risk, regardless of whether they are designated individuals.
*   **Exceptions:**  Specifies several exceptions to the prohibitions:
    *   Trades executed under pre-existing 10b5-1 trading plans.

*   **Preclearance:** Section 16 directors and officers must obtain preclearance from Corporate Legal for any transaction in NVIDIA's stock.
*   **Compliance, Violations, and Consequences:** Highlights the severe consequences of violating insider trading laws, including fines, imprisonment, and termination of employment.
*   **Speak Up/Reporting Concerns:** Encourages reporting potential violations to Corporate Legal anonymously through the Speak Up system (EthicsPoint). Guarantees confidentiality and non-retaliation for good-faith reporting.
*   **Questions:** Directs employees to Corporate Legal for questions about the policy.

**Section 3: Subsidiaries of Registrant**

This section lists the subsidiaries of NVIDIA Corporation as of January 26, 2025, omitting those that are not considered significant in the aggregate.

*   **Consent:** PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP consents to the incorporation by reference of their report dated February 26, 2025, relating to the financial statements, financial statement schedule, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, into various Form S-3 and Form S-8 registration statements.

**Section 5: Certification**

This section is a certification by Jen-Hsun Huang, likely the CEO, regarding the accuracy and completeness of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

*   **Certification:** Jen-Hsun Huang certifies that he has reviewed the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA Corporation and that, to the best of his knowledge, the report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements not misleading.

**Overall Summary and Key Takeaways**

The document encompasses several distinct areas related to NVIDIA's operations and compliance: the details of its employee stock purchase plan, insider trading policies, a list of its major subsidiaries, auditor's consent, and CEO certification. The ESPP definitions lay the groundwork for understanding employee stock options, while the insider trading policy aims to prevent illegal activities by setting strict rules about trading based on non-public information. The inclusion of subsidiary information and certifications confirms that NVIDIA's business operations are compliant and transparent.


This document comprises exhibits from NVIDIA Corporation's Form 10-K filing. It includes information about insider trading policy, a list of subsidiaries, consent of independent accounting firm, and certifications by the CEO and CFO.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Insider Trading Policy:** This section emphasizes the importance of reporting potential violations of the policy to Corporate Legal, offering an anonymous reporting option via NVIDIA's Speak Up system. It assures confidentiality and protection against retaliation for good-faith reports or cooperation with investigations. Contact information for Corporate Legal is provided for questions. The policy's name is explicitly stated as "Insider Trading Policy," owned by the Legal department, with global application. The last updated date is February 20, 2025, and it was effective as of September 22, 2021.

*   **Subsidiaries of Registrant:** This exhibit lists NVIDIA's subsidiaries as of January 26, 2025. It explicitly states that some subsidiaries have been omitted because they would not, in aggregate, constitute a significant subsidiary. The listed subsidiaries, all 100% owned, are Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (incorporated in Israel), NVIDIA International, Inc. (Delaware, U.S.), and NVIDIA Singapore Pte Ltd (Singapore).

*   **Consent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm:** PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP consents to the incorporation by reference of their audit report (dated February 26, 2025) related to the financial statements, financial statement schedule, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting into NVIDIA Corporation's Registration Statements on Form S-3 and Form S-8. The specific form numbers for the S-8 filings are listed.

*   **CEO Certification (Jen-Hsun Huang):** This is a certification by Jen-Hsun Huang, the President and CEO, regarding the accuracy and completeness of the Form 10-K. He certifies that the report does not contain untrue statements or omissions of material facts and that the financial statements fairly present NVIDIA's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Huang also confirms the establishment and maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, along with their effectiveness. He discloses any changes to internal control over financial reporting and reports any significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, or fraud to the auditors and audit committee.

*   **CFO Certification (Colette M. Kress):** This mirrors the CEO certification, but is provided by Colette M. Kress, the Executive Vice President and CFO. It covers the same points regarding the accuracy, completeness, and fairness of the Form 10-K, as well as the establishment and effectiveness of internal controls and reporting any deficiencies or fraud.

*   **Section 302 Certifications (Huang and Kress):** These are certifications pursuant to Rule 13a-14(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. § 1350). Both Jen-Hsun Huang and Colette M. Kress certify that the Annual Report on Form 10-K fully complies with the requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act and that the information contained in the report fairly presents the financial condition and results of operations of NVIDIA. It also states that a signed original of the written statement has been provided to NVIDIA and will be retained by them, furnished to the SEC upon request, and clarifies that the certification is not "filed" with the SEC and is not incorporated by reference into any other filings.


Okay, I will provide a detailed summary of the provided text, using chain-of-thought reasoning to preserve context and key details, while also being expansive.

**Chain of Thought Reasoning:**

1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The text describes a certification related to a Form 10-K filing by a company, which appears to be NVIDIA Corporation.
2.  **Clarify Ownership and Accessibility:**  The certification is owned by NVIDIA and will be provided to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or its staff if requested.  This indicates a compliance aspect.
3.  **Understand Filing Status:** The certification is *not* considered officially "filed" with the SEC. This is a key distinction.
4.  **Explain Non-Incorporation by Reference:** The crucial part is the statement that it should *not* be incorporated by reference into any other filings made by the company under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. This applies regardless of when the other filing is made (before or after the Form 10-K date) and irrespective of any general language within those other filings that might otherwise suggest incorporation.

**Summary:**

This text describes a certification associated with NVIDIA Corporation's Form 10-K report.  While NVIDIA retains ownership of the certification and will provide it to the SEC or its staff upon request, the certification itself is explicitly *not* considered a formally "filed" document with the SEC.  Critically, the text emphasizes that this certification *cannot* be incorporated by reference into any other filings made by NVIDIA under either the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act. This prohibition on incorporation applies to all such filings, regardless of their timing relative to the Form 10-K and overrides any general language in those other filings that might imply incorporation. This suggests a deliberate attempt to keep the certification separate and distinct from other SEC filings made by NVIDIA, potentially for legal or regulatory reasons relating to liability or scope. The presence of this clause indicates that the information in the certification is treated differently than other aspects of the company's reporting.
